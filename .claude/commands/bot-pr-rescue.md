description: Diagnose and salvage a failing Jules/bot PR — identify which gate failed, reproduce it locally, decide salvage vs close, and squash-force-push the fix. Use when the user pastes a Jules branch name, task id, or a bot PR with red CI.

Rescue a failing bot PR (Jules routines here: architect, bolt, janitor,
testpilot, typist). Pattern derived from the sibling fund repo's PR #692
(2026-09): a Testpilot PR red on the per-commit hygiene gate despite a clean
final tree, plus a 474-line `verify_output.txt` shipped by `git add -A`.

## 1. Identify the PR

A branch named `<kebab-slug>-<19-20 digit number>` is a **Jules branch** — the
trailing number is the Jules task id (`https://jules.google.com/task/<id>`).
Don't grep the repo for it; go straight to GitHub:

```bash
gh pr list --limit 15                       # branch column shows the slug
gh pr view <N> --json title,headRefName,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,files
gh pr checks <N>                            # which check is red
```

## 2. Diagnose the failing check

```bash
gh pr checks <N>                            # take the failing job's run URL
gh run view --job=<job-id> --log | grep -iE "fail|error" | head
```

**Gotcha — script echoes look like errors.** Actions echoes every line of a
`run:` script in cyan (`[36;1m`), including `echo "::error::..."` strings
inside if-branches that never executed. The real failure is the step whose
**own output** ends in `##[error]Process completed with exit code 1`. Read the
log bottom-up and match the error to the step above it, not to any cyan line.

Know the two fast PR-only guards that run before `make precommit` in `ci.yml`
(a failure in the first minute is one of these, not the test suite):

- **Reject empty pull request** — `git diff --quiet origin/main` at the merge
  ref. Fires when the PR's _net_ diff vs current main is empty, i.e. the work
  is already on main (duplicate) or the branch is a no-op. Not fixable by the
  bot — close the PR.
- **Reject bot PR hygiene violations** — `tools/check_bot_pr_hygiene.py`,
  **per-commit**: empty commits, zero-content files, deleted lines in test
  files (bot lanes are append-only in `__tests__/` and `tests/`), stray
  artifacts (`pr_body.txt`, `*.log`, `*_output.txt`, ...), and
  `eslint-suppressions.json` ratchet violations. A violation reverted by a
  later commit still fails — only squashing recovers it.

## 3. Reproduce locally

```bash
git fetch origin pull/<N>/head:pr<N>-head
git worktree add /tmp/pr<N> pr<N>-head --detach -f
cd /tmp/pr<N> && python3 tools/check_bot_pr_hygiene.py --base origin/main
```

## 4. Assess salvageability

Squash-simulate and re-run the gate — if the final tree is compliant, the
per-commit violations die with the history:

```bash
cd /tmp/pr<N>
git reset --soft $(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)
git commit -m "<conventional subject>"
python3 tools/check_bot_pr_hygiene.py --base origin/main
```

Then verify the content against **current main** (the bot's base may be stale):

```bash
git worktree add /tmp/pr<N>-main origin/main --detach -f
cd /tmp/pr<N>-main
git checkout pr<N>-head -- <changed files>
ln -s /Users/lz/dev/networking/node_modules node_modules   # worktrees lack deps
npx jest <changed test files>                # or: python3 -m pytest <changed test files>
```

Decide: net diff vs `origin/main` empty → **close as duplicate**. Content good
→ salvage (step 5). Content bad → close with a one-line reason.

## 5. Salvage

Work in the `/tmp/pr<N>` worktree (detached HEAD). Do **not** `git checkout -b`
a salvage branch in the main worktree — that hijacks the branch the user's
checkout is on; squash on the detached HEAD and push it directly:

```bash
git fetch origin <pr-branch>:refs/remotes/origin/<pr-branch>   # enables --force-with-lease
cd /tmp/pr<N>
git reset --soft $(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)
git commit -m "<conventional subject>

Co-authored-by: google-labs-jules[bot] <161369871+google-labs-jules[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>"
git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD:<pr-branch>
gh pr checks <N>                    # wait for ci green
gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch
git checkout main && git pull --rebase origin main
git branch -D pr<N>-head
git worktree remove /tmp/pr<N> --force; git worktree remove /tmp/pr<N>-main --force
```

The PR title must stay a valid Conventional Commit subject — it becomes the
squash-merge commit message. Count the characters before pushing (≤ 72,
lower-case scope per AGENTS.md): a `refactor(<scope>): extract helpers to cut
<long_function_name> complexity` template overflows for long names (the
sibling fund repo's PR #695 shipped a 73-char title) — shorten the verb
phrase, never the function name. When `gh pr edit` fails with GraphQL scope
errors (`read:org`), use
`gh api -X PATCH repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N> -f title="..."` instead.

**Gotcha — CI checks that validate the PR title read it from the event
payload, so `gh run rerun` replays the OLD title.** After retitling,
retrigger with a fresh event (a force-push, or `gh pr close` + `gh pr reopen`).

## 6. Fix forward (the point of the exercise)

A rescued PR means the harness let the bot produce dirty history. Patch the
cause, not just the symptom (interactive agents may edit `.jules/` personas and
gate scripts per AGENTS.md):

- `.jules/<routine>.md` — the recurring fix is **publish exactly one commit**
  (verify the final tree with `make precommit`, push once, amend/squash +
  force-push on revision) and **stage by name, never `git add -A`** (keeps
  scratch like `precommit_output.txt` out). Cite the PR number as the failure
  example.
- `tools/check_bot_pr_hygiene.py` — if the bot committed a scratch file the
  stray-artifact patterns missed, widen `_is_stray_artifact` (check
  `git ls-files` for false-positive collisions first) and add a test in
  `tools/__tests__/test_check_bot_pr_hygiene.py`.

Run `make precommit` green before committing (`make precommit-docker` on macOS
for CI parity — it exits 0 amid alarming-looking noise; judge by exit code,
see `docs/ci-gotchas.md`). Note in the commit body when the edit touches a
persona file.
