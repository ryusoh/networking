THE TRANSPORT LAYER
Together with the network layer, the transport layer is the heart of the proto-
col hierarchy. The network layer provides end-to-end packet delivery using data-
grams or virtual circuits. The transport layer builds on the network layer to pro-
vide data transport from a process on a source machine to a process on a destina-
tion machine with a desired level of reliability that is independent of the physical
networks currently in use. It provides the abstractions that applications need to
use the network. Without the transport layer, the whole concept of layered proto-
cols would make little sense. In this chapter, we will study the transport layer in
detail, including its services and choice of API design to tackle issues of reliabil-
ity, connections and congestion control, protocols such as TCP and UDP, and per-
formance.
6.1 THE TRANSPORT SERVICE
In the following sections, we will provide an introduction to the transport ser-
vice. We look at what kind of service is provided to the application layer. To
make the issue of transport service more concrete, we will examine two sets of
transport layer primitives. First comes a simple (but hypothetical) one to show the
basic ideas. Then comes the interface commonly used in the Internet.

6.1.1 Services Provided to the Upper Layers
The ultimate goal of the transport layer is to provide efficient, reliable, and
cost-effective data transmission service to its users, normally processes in the ap-
plication layer. To achieve this, the transport layer makes use of the services pro-
vided by the network layer. The software and/or hardware within the transport
layer that does the work is called the transport entity. The transport entity can
be located in the operating system kernel, in a library package bound into network
applications, in a separate user process, or even on the network interface card.
The first two options are most common on the Internet. The (logical) relationship
of the network, transport, and application layers is illustrated in Fig. 6-1.

Figure 6-1. The network, transport, and application layers.
Just as there are two types of network service, connection-oriented and con-
nectionless, there are also two types of transport service. The connection-oriented
transport service is similar to the connection-oriented network service in many
ways. In both cases, connections have three phases: establishment, data transfer,
and release. Addressing and flow control are also similar in both layers. Fur-
thermore, the connectionless transport service is also very similar to the con-
nectionless network service. However, note that it can be difficult to provide a
connectionless transport service on top of a connection-oriented network service,
since it is inefficient to set up a connection to send a single packet and then tear it
down immediately afterwards.
The obvious question is this: if the transport layer service is so similar to the
network layer service, why are there two distinct layers? Why is one layer not

adequate? The answer is subtle, but crucial. The transport code runs entirely on
the users’ machines, but the network layer mostly runs on the routers, which are
operated by the carrier (at least for a wide area network). What happens if the
network layer offers inadequate service? What if it frequently loses packets?
What happens if routers crash from time to time?
Problems occur, that’s what. The users have no real control over the network
layer, so they cannot solve the problem of poor service by using better routers or
putting more error handling in the data link layer because they don’t own the rout-
ers. The only possibility is to put on top of the network layer another layer that
improves the quality of the service. If, in a connectionless network, packets are
lost or mangled, the transport entity can detect the problem and compensate for it
by using retransmissions. If, in a connection-oriented network, a transport entity
is informed halfway through a long transmission that its network connection has
been abruptly terminated, with no indication of what has happened to the data cur-
rently in transit, it can set up a new network connection to the remote transport
entity. Using this new network connection, it can send a query to its peer asking
which data arrived and which did not, and knowing where it was, pick up from
where it left off.
In essence, the existence of the transport layer makes it possible for the tran-
sport service to be more reliable than the underlying network. Furthermore, the
transport primitives can be implemented as calls to library procedures to make
them independent of the network primitives. The network service calls may vary
considerably from one network to another (e.g., calls based on a connectionless
Ethernet may be quite different from calls on a connection-oriented WiMAX net-
work). Hiding the network service behind a set of transport service primitives
ensures that changing the network merely requires replacing one set of library
procedures with another one that does the same thing with a different underlying
service.
Thanks to the transport layer, application programmers can write code accord-
ing to a standard set of primitives and have these programs work on a wide variety
of networks, without having to worry about dealing with different network inter-
faces and levels of reliability. If all real networks were flawless and all had the
same service primitives and were guaranteed never, ever to change, the transport
layer might not be needed. However, in the real world it fulfills the key function
of isolating the upper layers from the technology, design, and imperfections of the
network.
For this reason, many people have made a qualitative distinction between lay-
ers 1 through 4 on the one hand and layer(s) above 4 on the other. The bottom
four layers can be seen as the transport service provider, whereas the upper
layer(s) are the transport service user. This distinction of provider versus user
has a considerable impact on the design of the layers and puts the transport layer
in a key position, since it forms the major boundary between the provider and user
of the reliable data transmission service. It is the level that applications see.

THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
6.1.2 Transport Service Primitives
To allow users to access the transport service, the transport layer must provide
some operations to application programs, that is, a transport service interface.
Each transport service has its own interface. In this section, we will first examine
a simple (hypothetical) transport service and its interface to see the bare essen-
tials. In the following section, we will look at a real example.
The transport service is similar to the network service, but there are also some
important differences. The main difference is that the network service is intended
to model the service offered by real networks, warts and all. Real networks can
lose packets, so the network service is generally unreliable.
The connection-oriented transport service, in contrast, is reliable. Of course,
real networks are not error-free, but that is precisely the purpose of the transport
layer—to provide a reliable service on top of an unreliable network.
As an example, consider two processes on a single machine connected by a
pipe in UNIX (or any other interprocess communication facility). They assume
the connection between them is 100% perfect. They do not want to know about
acknowledgements, lost packets, congestion, or anything at all like that. What
they want is a 100% reliable connection. Process A puts data into one end of the
pipe, and process B takes it out of the other. This is what the connection-oriented
transport service is all about—hiding the imperfections of the network service so
that user processes can just assume the existence of an error-free bit stream even
when they are on different machines.
As an aside, the transport layer can also provide unreliable (datagram) ser-
vice. However, there is relatively little to say about that besides ‘‘it’s datagrams,’’
so we will mainly concentrate on the connection-oriented transport service in this
chapter. Nevertheless, there are some applications, such as client-server comput-
ing and streaming multimedia, that build on a connectionless transport service,
and we will say a little bit about that later on.
A second difference between the network service and transport service is
whom the services are intended for. The network service is used only by the tran-
sport entities. Few users write their own transport entities, and thus few users or
programs ever see the bare network service. In contrast, many programs (and thus
programmers) see the transport primitives. Consequently, the transport service
must be convenient and easy to use.
To get an idea of what a transport service might be like, consider the five
primitives listed in Fig. 6-2. This transport interface is truly bare bones, but it
gives the essential flavor of what a connection-oriented transport interface has to
do. It allows application programs to establish, use, and then release connections,
which is sufficient for many applications.
To see how these primitives might be used, consider an application with a ser-
ver and a number of remote clients. To start with, the server executes a LISTEN
primitive, typically by calling a library procedure that makes a system call that

blocks the server until a client turns up. When a client wants to talk to the server,
it executes a CONNECT primitive. The transport entity carries out this primitive by
blocking the caller and sending a packet to the server. Encapsulated in the pay-
load of this packet is a transport layer message for the server’s transport entity.
A quick note on terminology is now in order. For lack of a better term, we
will use the term segment for messages sent from transport entity to transport en-
tity. TCP, UDP and other Internet protocols use this term. Some older protocols
used the ungainly name TPDU (Transport Protocol Data Unit). That term is
not used much any more now but you may see it in older papers and books.
Thus, segments (exchanged by the transport layer) are contained in packets
(exchanged by the network layer). In turn, these packets are contained in frames
(exchanged by the data link layer). When a frame arrives, the data link layer
processes the frame header and, if the destination address matches for local deliv-
ery, passes the contents of the frame payload field up to the network entity. The
network entity similarly processes the packet header and then passes the contents
of the packet payload up to the transport entity. This nesting is illustrated in
Fig. 6-3.

Getting back to our client-server example, the client’s CONNECT call causes a

transport entity checks to see that the server is blocked on a LISTEN (i.e., is inter-
ested in handling requests). If so, it then unblocks the server and sends a CON-
NECTION ACCEPTED segment back to the client. When this segment arrives, the
client is unblocked and the connection is established.
Data can now be exchanged using the SEND and RECEIVE primitives. In the
simplest form, either party can do a (blocking) RECEIVE to wait for the other party
to do a SEND. When the segment arrives, the receiver is unblocked. It can then
process the segment and send a reply. As long as both sides can keep track of
whose turn it is to send, this scheme works fine.
Note that in the transport layer, even a simple unidirectional data exchange is
more complicated than at the network layer. Every data packet sent will also be
acknowledged (eventually).
The packets bearing control segments are also
acknowledged, implicitly or explicitly. These acknowledgements are managed by
the transport entities, using the network layer protocol, and are not visible to the
transport users. Similarly, the transport entities need to worry about timers and
retransmissions. None of this machinery is visible to the transport users. To the
transport users, a connection is a reliable bit pipe: one user stuffs bits in and they
magically appear in the same order at the other end. This ability to hide com-
plexity is the reason that layered protocols are such a powerful tool.
When a connection is no longer needed, it must be released to free up table
space within the two transport entities. Disconnection has two variants: asymmet-
ric and symmetric. In the asymmetric variant, either transport user can issue a
DISCONNECT primitive, which results in a DISCONNECT segment being sent to the
remote transport entity. Upon its arrival, the connection is released.
In the symmetric variant, each direction is closed separately, independently of
the other one. When one side does a DISCONNECT, that means it has no more data
to send but it is still willing to accept data from its partner. In this model, a con-
nection is released when both sides have done a DISCONNECT.
A state diagram for connection establishment and release for these simple
primitives is given in Fig. 6-4. Each transition is triggered by some event, either a
primitive executed by the local transport user or an incoming packet. For simpli-
city, we assume here that each segment is separately acknowledged. We also as-
sume that a symmetric disconnection model is used, with the client going first.
Please note that this model is quite unsophisticated. We will look at more realis-
tic models later on when we describe how TCP works.
6.1.3 Berkeley Sockets
Let us now briefly inspect another set of transport primitives, the socket prim-
itives as they are used for TCP. Sockets were first released as part of the Berke-
ley UNIX 4.2BSD software distribution in 1983. They quickly became popular.
The primitives are now widely used for Internet programming on many operating

systems, especially UNIX-based systems, and there is a socket-style API for Win-
dows called ‘‘winsock.’’
The primitives are listed in Fig. 6-5. Roughly speaking, they follow the mo-
del of our first example but offer more features and flexibility. We will not look
at the corresponding segments here. That discussion will come later.

CHAP. 6
The first four primitives in the list are executed in that order by servers. The
SOCKET primitive creates a new endpoint and allocates table space for it within
the transport entity. The parameters of the call specify the addressing format to
be used, the type of service desired (e.g., reliable byte stream), and the protocol.
A successful SOCKET call returns an ordinary file descriptor for use in succeeding
calls, the same way an OPEN call on a file does.
Newly created sockets do not have network addresses. These are assigned
using the BIND primitive. Once a server has bound an address to a socket, remote
clients can connect to it. The reason for not having the SOCKET call create an ad-
dress directly is that some processes care about their addresses (e.g., they have
been using the same address for years and everyone knows this address), whereas
others do not.
Next comes the LISTEN call, which allocates space to queue incoming calls for
the case that several clients try to connect at the same time. In contrast to LISTEN
in our first example, in the socket model LISTEN is not a blocking call.
To block waiting for an incoming connection, the server executes an ACCEPT
primitive. When a segment asking for a connection arrives, the transport entity
creates a new socket with the same properties as the original one and returns a file
descriptor for it. The server can then fork off a process or thread to handle the
connection on the new socket and go back to waiting for the next connection on
the original socket. ACCEPT returns a file descriptor, which can be used for read-
ing and writing in the standard way, the same as for files.
Now let us look at the client side. Here, too, a socket must first be created
using the SOCKET primitive, but BIND is not required since the address used does
not matter to the server. The CONNECT primitive blocks the caller and actively
starts the connection process. When it completes (i.e., when the appropriate seg-
ment is received from the server), the client process is unblocked and the con-
nection is established. Both sides can now use SEND and RECEIVE to transmit and
receive data over the full-duplex connection. The standard UNIX READ and WRITE
system calls can also be used if none of the special options of SEND and RECEIVE
are required.
Connection release with sockets is symmetric. When both sides have exe-
cuted a CLOSE primitive, the connection is released.
Sockets have proved tremendously popular and are the de facto standard for
abstracting transport services to applications. The socket API is often used with
the TCP protocol to provide a connection-oriented service called a reliable byte
stream, which is simply the reliable bit pipe that we described. However, other
protocols could be used to implement this service using the same API. It should
all be the same to the transport service users.
A strength of the socket API is that is can be used by an application for other
transport services. For instance, sockets can be used with a connectionless tran-
sport service. In this case, CONNECT sets the address of the remote transport peer
and SEND and RECEIVE send and receive datagrams to and from the remote peer.

(It is also common to use an expanded set of calls, for example, SENDTO and
RECEIVEFROM, that emphasize messages and do not limit an application to a sin-
gle transport peer.) Sockets can also be used with transport protocols that provide
a message stream rather than a byte stream and that do or do not have congestion
control. For example, DCCP (Datagram Congestion Controlled Protocol) is a
version of UDP with congestion control (Kohler et al., 2006). It is up to the tran-
sport users to understand what service they are getting.
However, sockets are not likely to be the final word on transport interfaces.
For example, applications often work with a group of related streams, such as a
Web browser that requests several objects from the same server. With sockets, the
most natural fit is for application programs to use one stream per object. This
structure means that congestion control is applied separately for each stream, not
across the group, which is suboptimal. It punts to the application the burden of
managing the set. Newer protocols and interfaces have been devised that support
groups of related streams more effectively and simply for the application. Two
examples are SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) defined in RFC
4960 and SST (Structured Stream Transport) (Ford, 2007). These protocols
must change the socket API slightly to get the benefits of groups of related
streams, and they also support features such as a mix of connection-oriented and
connectionless traffic and even multiple network paths. Time will tell if they are
successful.
6.1.4 An Example of Socket Programming: An Internet File Server
As an example of the nitty-gritty of how real socket calls are made, consider
the client and server code of Fig. 6-6. Here we have a very primitive Internet file
server along with an example client that uses it. The code has many limitations
(discussed below), but in principle the server code can be compiled and run on
any UNIX system connected to the Internet. The client code can be compiled and
run on any other UNIX machine on the Internet, anywhere in the world. The cli-
ent code can be executed with appropriate parameters to fetch any file to which
the server has access on its machine. The file is written to standard output, which,
of course, can be redirected to a file or pipe.
Let us look at the server code first. It starts out by including some standard
headers, the last three of which contain the main Internet-related definitions and
data structures. Next comes a definition of SERVER PORT as 12345. This num-
ber was chosen arbitrarily. Any number between 1024 and 65535 will work just
as well, as long as it is not in use by some other process; ports below 1023 are re-
served for privileged users.
The next two lines in the server define two constants needed. The first one
determines the chunk size in bytes used for the file transfer. The second one de-
termines how many pending connections can be held before additional ones are
discarded upon arrival.

After the declarations of local variables, the server code begins. It starts out
by initializing a data structure that will hold the server’s IP address. This data
structure will soon be bound to the server’s socket. The call to memset sets the
data structure to all 0s. The three assignments following it fill in three of its
fields. The last of these contains the server’s port. The functions htonl and htons
have to do with converting values to a standard format so the code runs correctly
on both little-endian machines (e.g., Intel x86) and big-endian machines (e.g., the
SPARC). Their exact semantics are not relevant here.
Next, the server creates a socket and checks for errors (indicated by s < 0). In
a production version of the code, the error message could be a trifle more explana-
tory. The call to setsockopt is needed to allow the port to be reused so the server
can run indefinitely, fielding request after request. Now the IP address is bound to
the socket and a check is made to see if the call to bind succeeded. The final step
in the initialization is the call to listen to announce the server’s willingness to ac-
cept incoming calls and tell the system to hold up to QUEUE SIZE of them in
case new requests arrive while the server is still processing the current one. If the
queue is full and additional requests arrive, they are quietly discarded.
At this point, the server enters its main loop, which it never leaves. The only
way to stop it is to kill it from outside. The call to accept blocks the server until
some client tries to establish a connection with it. If the accept call succeeds, it
returns a socket descriptor that can be used for reading and writing, analogous to
how file descriptors can be used to read from and write to pipes. However, unlike
pipes, which are unidirectional, sockets are bidirectional, so sa (the accepted
socket) can be used for reading from the connection and also for writing to it. A
pipe file descriptor is for reading or writing but not both.
After the connection is established, the server reads the file name from it. If
the name is not yet available, the server blocks waiting for it. After getting the
file name, the server opens the file and enters a loop that alternately reads blocks
from the file and writes them to the socket until the entire file has been copied.
Then the server closes the file and the connection and waits for the next con-
nection to show up. It repeats this loop forever.
Now let us look at the client code. To understand how it works, it is neces-
sary to understand how it is invoked. Assuming it is called client, a typical call is
client flits.cs.vu.nl /usr/tom/filename >f
This call only works if the server is already running on flits.cs.vu.nl and the file
/usr/tom/filename exists and the server has read access to it. If the call is suc-
cessful, the file is transferred over the Internet and written to f, after which the cli-
ent program exits. Since the server continues after a transfer, the client can be
started again and again to get other files.
The client code starts with some includes and declarations. Execution begins
by checking to see if it has been called with the right number of arguments (argc
= 3 means the program name plus two arguments). Note that argv [1] contains the

name of the server (e.g., flits.cs.vu.nl) and is converted to an IP address by
gethostbyname. This function uses DNS to look up the name. We will study DNS
in Chap. 7.
Next, a socket is created and initialized. After that, the client attempts to es-
tablish a TCP connection to the server, using connect. If the server is up and run-
ning on the named machine and attached to SERVER PORT and is either idle or
has room in its listen queue, the connection will (eventually) be established.
Using the connection, the client sends the name of the file by writing on the
socket. The number of bytes sent is one larger than the name proper, since the 0
byte terminating the name must also be sent to tell the server where the name
ends.
Now the client enters a loop, reading the file block by block from the socket
and copying it to standard output. When it is done, it just exits.
The procedure fatal prints an error message and exits. The server needs the
same procedure, but it was omitted due to lack of space on the page. Since the
client and server are compiled separately and normally run on different com-
puters, they cannot share the code of fatal.
These two programs (as well as other material related to this book) can be
fetched from the book’s Web site
http://www.pearsonhighered.com/tanenbaum
Just for the record, this server is not the last word in serverdom. Its error
checking is meager and its error reporting is mediocre. Since it handles all re-
quests strictly sequentially (because it has only a single thread), its performance is
poor. It has clearly never heard about security, and using bare UNIX system calls
is not the way to gain platform independence. It also makes some assumptions
that are technically illegal, such as assuming that the file name fits in the buffer
and is transmitted atomically. These shortcomings notwithstanding, it is a work-
ing Internet file server. In the exercises, the reader is invited to improve it. For
more information about programming with sockets, see Donahoo and Calvert
(2008, 2009).
6.2 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS
The transport service is implemented by a transport protocol used between
the two transport entities. In some ways, transport protocols resemble the data
link protocols we studied in detail in Chap. 3. Both have to deal with error con-
trol, sequencing, and flow control, among other issues.
However, significant differences between the two also exist.
These dif-
ferences are due to major dissimilarities between the environments in which the
two protocols operate, as shown in Fig. 6-7. At the data link layer, two routers

at the transport layer, this physical channel is replaced by the entire network. This
difference has many important implications for the protocols.

For one thing, over point-to-point links such as wires or optical fiber, it is
usually not necessary for a router to specify which router it wants to talk to—each
outgoing line leads directly to a particular router. In the transport layer, explicit
addressing of destinations is required.
For another thing, the process of establishing a connection over the wire of
Fig. 6-7(a) is simple: the other end is always there (unless it has crashed, in which
case it is not there). Either way, there is not much to do. Even on wireless links,
the process is not much different. Just sending a message is sufficient to have it
reach all other destinations. If the message is not acknowledged due to an error, it
can be resent. In the transport layer, initial connection establishment is complicat-
ed, as we will see.
Another (exceedingly annoying) difference between the data link layer and
the transport layer is the potential existence of storage capacity in the network.
When a router sends a packet over a link, it may arrive or be lost, but it cannot
bounce around for a while, go into hiding in a far corner of the world, and sudden-
ly emerge after other packets that were sent much later. If the network uses data-
grams, which are independently routed inside, there is a nonnegligible probability
that a packet may take the scenic route and arrive late and out of the expected
order, or even that duplicates of the packet will arrive. The consequences of the
network’s ability to delay and duplicate packets can sometimes be disastrous and
can require the use of special protocols to correctly transport information.
A final difference between the data link and transport layers is one of degree
rather than of kind. Buffering and flow control are needed in both layers, but the
presence in the transport layer of a large and varying number of connections with
bandwidth that fluctuates as the connections compete with each other may require
a different approach than we used in the data link layer. Some of the protocols
discussed in Chap. 3 allocate a fixed number of buffers to each line, so that when
a frame arrives a buffer is always available. In the transport layer, the larger num-
ber of connections that must be managed and variations in the bandwidth each

connection may receive make the idea of dedicating many buffers to each one less
attractive. In the following sections, we will examine all of these important is-
sues, and others.
6.2.1 Addressing
When an application (e.g., a user) process wishes to set up a connection to a
remote application process, it must specify which one to connect to. (Con-
nectionless transport has the same problem: to whom should each message be
sent?) The method normally used is to define transport addresses to which proc-
esses can listen for connection requests. In the Internet, these endpoints are called
ports. We will use the generic term TSAP (Transport Service Access Point) to
mean a specific endpoint in the transport layer. The analogous endpoints in the
network layer (i.e., network layer addresses) are not-surprisingly called NSAPs
(Network Service Access Points). IP addresses are examples of NSAPs.
Figure 6-8 illustrates the relationship between the NSAPs, the TSAPs, and a
transport connection. Application processes, both clients and servers, can attach
themselves to a local TSAP to establish a connection to a remote TSAP. These
connections run through NSAPs on each host, as shown. The purpose of having
TSAPs is that in some networks, each computer has a single NSAP, so some way
is needed to distinguish multiple transport endpoints that share that NSAP.

THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
A possible scenario for a transport connection is as follows:
1. A mail server process attaches itself to TSAP 1522 on host 2 to wait
for an incoming call. How a process attaches itself to a TSAP is out-
side the networking model and depends entirely on the local operat-
ing system. A call such as our LISTEN might be used, for example.
2. An application process on host 1 wants to send an email message, so
it attaches itself to TSAP 1208 and issues a CONNECT request. The
request specifies TSAP 1208 on host 1 as the source and TSAP 1522
on host 2 as the destination. This action ultimately results in a tran-
sport connection being established between the application process
and the server.
3. The application process sends over the mail message.
4. The mail server responds to say that it will deliver the message.
5. The transport connection is released.
Note that there may well be other servers on host 2 that are attached to other
TSAPs and are waiting for incoming connections that arrive over the same NSAP.
The picture painted above is fine, except we have swept one little problem
under the rug: how does the user process on host 1 know that the mail server is at-
tached to TSAP 1522? One possibility is that the mail server has been attaching
itself to TSAP 1522 for years and gradually all the network users have learned
this. In this model, services have stable TSAP addresses that are listed in files in
well-known places. For example, the /etc/services file on UNIX systems lists
which servers are permanently attached to which ports, including the fact that the
mail server is found on TCP port 25.
While stable TSAP addresses work for a small number of key services that
never change (e.g., the Web server), user processes, in general, often want to talk
to other user processes that do not have TSAP addresses that are known in ad-
vance, or that may exist for only a short time.
To handle this situation, an alternative scheme can be used. In this scheme,
there exists a special process called a portmapper. To find the TSAP address
corresponding to a given service name, such as ‘‘BitTorrent,’’ a user sets up a con-
nection to the portmapper (which listens to a well-known TSAP). The user then
sends a message specifying the service name, and the portmapper sends back the
TSAP address. Then the user releases the connection with the portmapper and es-
tablishes a new one with the desired service.
In this model, when a new service is created, it must register itself with the
portmapper, giving both its service name (typically, an ASCII string) and its
TSAP. The portmapper records this information in its internal database so that
when queries come in later, it will know the answers.

The function of the portmapper is analogous to that of a directory assistance
operator in the telephone system—it provides a mapping of names onto numbers.
Just as in the telephone system, it is essential that the address of the well-known
TSAP used by the portmapper is indeed well known. If you do not know the
number of the information operator, you cannot call the information operator to
find it out. If you think the number you dial for information is obvious, try it in a
foreign country sometime.
Many of the server processes that can exist on a machine will be used only
rarely. It is wasteful to have each of them active and listening to a stable TSAP
address all day long. An alternative scheme is shown in Fig. 6-9 in a simplified
form. It is known as the initial connection protocol. Instead of every conceiv-
able server listening at a well-known TSAP, each machine that wishes to offer
services to remote users has a special process server that acts as a proxy for less
heavily used servers. This server is called inetd on UNIX systems. It listens to a
set of ports at the same time, waiting for a connection request. Potential users of a
service begin by doing a CONNECT request, specifying the TSAP address of the
service they want. If no server is waiting for them, they get a connection to the
process server, as shown in Fig. 6-9(a).

does the requested work, while the process server goes back to listening for new
requests, as shown in Fig. 6-9(b). This method is only applicable when servers
can be created on demand.
6.2.2 Connection Establishment
Establishing a connection sounds easy, but it is actually surprisingly tricky.
At first glance, it would seem sufficient for one transport entity to just send a
CONNECTION REQUEST segment to the destination and wait for a CONNECTION
ACCEPTED reply. The problem occurs when the network can lose, delay, corrupt,
and duplicate packets. This behavior causes serious complications.
Imagine a network that is so congested that acknowledgements hardly ever
get back in time and each packet times out and is retransmitted two or three times.
Suppose that the network uses datagrams inside and that every packet follows a
different route. Some of the packets might get stuck in a traffic jam inside the
network and take a long time to arrive. That is, they may be delayed in the net-
work and pop out much later, when the sender thought that they had been lost.
The worst possible nightmare is as follows. A user establishes a connection
with a bank, sends messages telling the bank to transfer a large amount of money
to the account of a not-entirely-trustworthy person. Unfortunately, the packets de-
cide to take the scenic route to the destination and go off exploring a remote
corner of the network. The sender then times out and sends them all again. This
time the packets take the shortest route and are delivered quickly so the sender re-
leases the connection.
Unfortunately, eventually the initial batch of packets finally come out of hid-
ing and arrive at the destination in order, asking the bank to establish a new con-
nection and transfer money (again). The bank has no way of telling that these are
duplicates. It must assume that this is a second, independent transaction, and
transfers the money again.
This scenario may sound unlikely, or even implausible but the point is this:
protocols must be designed to be correct in all cases. Only the common cases need
be implemented efficiently to obtain good network performance, but the protocol
must be able to cope with the uncommon cases without breaking. If it cannot, we
have built a fair-weather network that can fail without warning when the condi-
tions get tough.
For the remainder of this section, we will study the problem of delayed dupli-
cates, with emphasis on algorithms for establishing connections in a reliable way,
so that nightmares like the one above cannot happen. The crux of the problem is
that the delayed duplicates are thought to be new packets. We cannot prevent
packets from being duplicated and delayed. But if and when this happens, the
packets must be rejected as duplicates and not processed as fresh packets.
The problem can be attacked in various ways, none of them very satisfactory.
One way is to use throwaway transport addresses. In this approach, each time a

transport address is needed, a new one is generated. When a connection is re-
leased, the address is discarded and never used again. Delayed duplicate packets
then never find their way to a transport process and can do no damage. However,
this approach makes it more difficult to connect with a process in the first place.
Another possibility is to give each connection a unique identifier (i.e., a se-
quence number incremented for each connection established) chosen by the ini-
tiating party and put in each segment, including the one requesting the connection.
After each connection is released, each transport entity can update a table listing
obsolete connections as (peer transport entity, connection identifier) pairs. When-
ever a connection request comes in, it can be checked against the table to see if it
belongs to a previously released connection.
Unfortunately, this scheme has a basic flaw: it requires each transport entity to
maintain a certain amount of history information indefinitely. This history must
persist at both the source and destination machines. Otherwise, if a machine
crashes and loses its memory, it will no longer know which connection identifiers
have already been used by its peers.
Instead, we need to take a different tack to simplify the problem. Rather than
allowing packets to live forever within the network, we devise a mechanism to
kill off aged packets that are still hobbling about. With this restriction, the prob-
lem becomes somewhat more manageable.
Packet lifetime can be restricted to a known maximum using one (or more) of
the following techniques:
1. Restricted network design.
2. Putting a hop counter in each packet.
3. Timestamping each packet.
The first technique includes any method that prevents packets from looping, com-
bined with some way of bounding delay including congestion over the (now
known) longest possible path. It is difficult, given that internets may range from a
single city to international in scope. The second method consists of having the
hop count initialized to some appropriate value and decremented each time the
packet is forwarded. The network protocol simply discards any packet whose hop
counter becomes zero. The third method requires each packet to bear the time it
was created, with the routers agreeing to discard any packet older than some
agreed-upon time. This latter method requires the router clocks to be synchron-
ized, which itself is a nontrivial task, and in practice a hop counter is a close
enough approximation to age.
In practice, we will need to guarantee not only that a packet is dead, but also
that all acknowledgements to it are dead, too, so we will now introduce a period
T, which is some small multiple of the true maximum packet lifetime. The maxi-
mum packet lifetime is a conservative constant for a network; for the Internet, it is
somewhat arbitrarily taken to be 120 seconds. The multiple is protocol dependent

---

## Page 20

and simply has the effect of making T longer. If we wait a time T secs after a
packet has been sent, we can be sure that all traces of it are now gone and that nei-
ther it nor its acknowledgements will suddenly appear out of the blue to compli-
cate matters.
With packet lifetimes bounded, it is possible to devise a practical and fool-
proof way to reject delayed duplicate segments. The method described below is
due to Tomlinson (1975), as refined by Sunshine and Dalal (1978). Variants of it
are widely used in practice, including in TCP.
The heart of the method is for the source to label segments with sequence
numbers that will not be reused within T secs. The period, T, and the rate of pack-
ets per second determine the size of the sequence numbers. In this way, only one
packet with a given sequence number may be outstanding at any given time. Dup-
licates of this packet may still occur, and they must be discarded by the destina-
tion. However, it is no longer the case that a delayed duplicate of an old packet
may beat a new packet with the same sequence number and be accepted by the
destination in its stead.
To get around the problem of a machine losing all memory of where it was
after a crash, one possibility is to require transport entities to be idle for T secs
after a recovery. The idle period will let all old segments die off, so the sender can
start again with any sequence number. However, in a complex internetwork, T
may be large, so this strategy is unattractive.
Instead, Tomlinson proposed equipping each host with a time-of-day clock.
The clocks at different hosts need not be synchronized. Each clock is assumed to
take the form of a binary counter that increments itself at uniform intervals. Fur-
thermore, the number of bits in the counter must equal or exceed the number of
bits in the sequence numbers. Last, and most important, the clock is assumed to
continue running even if the host goes down.
When a connection is set up, the low-order k bits of the clock are used as the
k-bit initial sequence number. Thus, unlike our protocols of Chap. 3, each con-
nection starts numbering its segments with a different initial sequence number.
The sequence space should be so large that by the time sequence numbers wrap
around, old segments with the same sequence number are long gone. This linear
relation between time and initial sequence numbers is shown in Fig. 6-10(a). The
forbidden region shows the times for which segment sequence numbers are illegal
leading up to their use. If any segment is sent with a sequence number in this re-
gion, it could be delayed and impersonate a different packet with the same se-
quence number that will be issued slightly later. For example, if the host crashes
and restarts at time 70 seconds, it will use initial sequence numbers based on the
clock to pick up after it left off; the host does not start with a lower sequence
number in the forbidden region.
Once both transport entities have agreed on the initial sequence number, any
sliding window protocol can be used for data flow control. This window protocol
will correctly find and discard duplicates of packets after they have already been

accepted. In reality, the initial sequence number curve (shown by the heavy line)
is not linear, but a staircase, since the clock advances in discrete steps. For sim-
plicity, we will ignore this detail.
To keep packet sequence numbers out of the forbidden region, we need to
take care in two respects. We can get into trouble in two distinct ways. If a host
sends too much data too fast on a newly opened connection, the actual sequence
number versus time curve may rise more steeply than the initial sequence number
versus time curve, causing the sequence number to enter the forbidden region. To
prevent this from happening, the maximum data rate on any connection is one
segment per clock tick. This also means that the transport entity must wait until
the clock ticks before opening a new connection after a crash restart, lest the same
number be used twice. Both of these points argue in favor of a short clock tick (1
μsec or less). But the clock cannot tick too fast relative to the sequence number.
For a clock rate of C and a sequence number space of size S, we must have
S/C>T so that the sequence numbers cannot wrap around too quickly.
Entering the forbidden region from underneath by sending too fast is not the
only way to get into trouble. From Fig. 6-10(b), we see that at any data rate less
than the clock rate, the curve of actual sequence numbers used versus time will
eventually run into the forbidden region from the left as the sequence numbers
wrap around. The greater the slope of the actual sequence numbers, the longer
this event will be delayed. Avoiding this situation limits how slowly sequence
numbers can advance on a connection (or how long the connections may last).
The clock-based method solves the problem of not being able to distinguish
delayed duplicate segments from new segments. However, there is a practical
snag for using it for establishing connections. Since we do not normally remember
sequence numbers across connections at the destination, we still have no way of

---

## Page 22

THE TRANSPORT LAYER

knowing if a CONNECTION REQUEST segment containing an initial sequence
number is a duplicate of a recent connection. This snag does not exist during a
connection because the sliding window protocol does remember the current se-
quence number.
To solve this specific problem, Tomlinson (1975) introduced the three-way
handshake. This establishment protocol involves one peer checking with the
other that the connection request is indeed current. The normal setup procedure
when host 1 initiates is shown in Fig. 6-11(a). Host 1 chooses a sequence number,
x, and sends a CONNECTION REQUEST segment containing it to host 2. Host 2
replies with an ACK segment acknowledging x and announcing its own initial se-
quence number, y. Finally, host 1 acknowledges host 2’s choice of an initial se-
quence number in the first data segment that it sends.
Now let us see how the three-way handshake works in the presence of delayed
duplicate control segments. In Fig. 6-11(b), the first segment is a delayed dupli-
cate CONNECTION REQUEST from an old connection. This segment arrives at
host 2 without host 1’s knowledge. Host 2 reacts to this segment by sending host
1 an ACK segment, in effect asking for verification that host 1 was indeed trying
to set up a new connection. When host 1 rejects host 2’s attempt to establish a
connection, host 2 realizes that it was tricked by a delayed duplicate and abandons
the connection. In this way, a delayed duplicate does no damage.
The worst case is when both a delayed CONNECTION REQUEST and an ACK
are floating around in the subnet. This case is shown in Fig. 6-11(c). As in the
previous example, host 2 gets a delayed CONNECTION REQUEST and replies to
it. At this point, it is crucial to realize that host 2 has proposed using y as the ini-
tial sequence number for host 2 to host 1 traffic, knowing full well that no seg-
ments containing sequence number y or acknowledgements to y are still in exist-
ence. When the second delayed segment arrives at host 2, the fact that z has been
acknowledged rather than y tells host 2 that this, too, is an old duplicate. The im-
portant thing to realize here is that there is no combination of old segments that
can cause the protocol to fail and have a connection set up by accident when no
one wants it.
TCP uses this three-way handshake to establish connections. Within a con-
nection, a timestamp is used to extend the 32-bit sequence number so that it will
not wrap within the maximum packet lifetime, even for gigabit-per-second con-
nections. This mechanism is a fix to TCP that was needed as it was used on faster
and faster links. It is described in RFC 1323 and called PAWS (Protection
Against Wrapped Sequence numbers). Across connections, for the initial se-
quence numbers and before PAWS can come into play, TCP originally used the
clock-based scheme just described. However, this turned out to have a security
vulnerability. The clock made it easy for an attacker to predict the next initial se-
quence number and send packets that tricked the three-way handshake and estab-
lished a forged connection. To close this hole, pseudorandom initial sequence
numbers are used for connections in practice. However, it remains important that

the initial sequence numbers not repeat for an interval even though they appear

6.2.3 Connection Release
Releasing a connection is easier than establishing one. Nevertheless, there are
more pitfalls than one might expect here. As we mentioned earlier, there are two
styles of terminating a connection: asymmetric release and symmetric release.

---

## Page 24

THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
Asymmetric release is the way the telephone system works: when one party hangs
up, the connection is broken. Symmetric release treats the connection as two sep-
arate unidirectional connections and requires each one to be released separately.
Asymmetric release is abrupt and may result in data loss. Consider the scen-
ario of Fig. 6-12. After the connection is established, host 1 sends a segment that
arrives properly at host 2. Then host 1 sends another segment. Unfortunately,
host 2 issues a DISCONNECT before the second segment arrives. The result is that
the connection is released and data are lost.

Clearly, a more sophisticated release protocol is needed to avoid data loss.
One way is to use symmetric release, in which each direction is released indepen-
dently of the other one. Here, a host can continue to receive data even after it has
sent a DISCONNECT segment.
Symmetric release does the job when each process has a fixed amount of data
to send and clearly knows when it has sent it. In other situations, determining that
all the work has been done and the connection should be terminated is not so ob-
vious. One can envision a protocol in which host 1 says ‘‘I am done. Are you
done too?’’ If host 2 responds: ‘‘I am done too. Goodbye, the connection can be
safely released.’’
Unfortunately, this protocol does not always work. There is a famous prob-
lem that illustrates this issue. It is called the two-army problem. Imagine that a
white army is encamped in a valley, as shown in Fig. 6-13. On both of the sur-
rounding hillsides are blue armies. The white army is larger than either of the
blue armies alone, but together the blue armies are larger than the white army. If
either blue army attacks by itself, it will be defeated, but if the two blue armies at-
tack simultaneously, they will be victorious.
The blue armies want to synchronize their attacks. However, their only com-
munication medium is to send messengers on foot down into the valley, where

they might be captured and the message lost (i.e., they have to use an unreliable
communication channel). The question is: does a protocol exist that allows the
blue armies to win?
Suppose that the commander of blue army #1 sends a message reading: ‘‘I
propose we attack at dawn on March 29. How about it?’’ Now suppose that the
message arrives, the commander of blue army #2 agrees, and his reply gets safely
back to blue army #1. Will the attack happen? Probably not, because commander
#2 does not know if his reply got through. If it did not, blue army #1 will not at-
tack, so it would be foolish for him to charge into battle.
Now let us improve the protocol by making it a three-way handshake. The
initiator of the original proposal must acknowledge the response. Assuming no
messages are lost, blue army #2 will get the acknowledgement, but the com-
mander of blue army #1 will now hesitate. After all, he does not know if his ac-
knowledgement got through, and if it did not, he knows that blue army #2 will not
attack. We could now make a four-way handshake protocol, but that does not
help either.
In fact, it can be proven that no protocol exists that works. Suppose that some
protocol did exist. Either the last message of the protocol is essential, or it is not.
If it is not, we can remove it (and any other unessential messages) until we are left
with a protocol in which every message is essential. What happens if the final
message does not get through? We just said that it was essential, so if it is lost,
the attack does not take place. Since the sender of the final message can never be
sure of its arrival, he will not risk attacking. Worse yet, the other blue army
knows this, so it will not attack either.
To see the relevance of the two-army problem to releasing connections, rather
than to military affairs, just substitute ‘‘disconnect’’ for ‘‘attack.’’ If neither side is

prepared to disconnect until it is convinced that the other side is prepared to
disconnect too, the disconnection will never happen.
In practice, we can avoid this quandary by foregoing the need for agreement
and pushing the problem up to the transport user, letting each side independently
decide when it is done. This is an easier problem to solve. Figure 6-14 illustrates
four scenarios of releasing using a three-way handshake. While this protocol is
not infallible, it is usually adequate.
In Fig. 6-14(a), we see the normal case in which one of the users sends a DR
(DISCONNECTION REQUEST) segment to initiate the connection release. When
it arrives, the recipient sends back a DR segment and starts a timer, just in case its
DR is lost. When this DR arrives, the original sender sends back an ACK segment
and releases the connection. Finally, when the ACK segment arrives, the receiver
also releases the connection. Releasing a connection means that the transport en-
tity removes the information about the connection from its table of currently open
connections and signals the connection’s owner (the transport user) somehow.
This action is different from a transport user issuing a DISCONNECT primitive.
If the final ACK segment is lost, as shown in Fig. 6-14(b), the situation is
saved by the timer. When the timer expires, the connection is released anyway.
Now consider the case of the second DR being lost. The user initiating the
disconnection will not receive the expected response, will time out, and will start
all over again. In Fig. 6-14(c), we see how this works, assuming that the second
time no segments are lost and all segments are delivered correctly and on time.
Our last scenario, Fig. 6-14(d), is the same as Fig. 6-14(c) except that now we
assume all the repeated attempts to retransmit the DR also fail due to lost seg-
ments. After N retries, the sender just gives up and releases the connection.
Meanwhile, the receiver times out and also exits.
While this protocol usually suffices, in theory it can fail if the initial DR and
N retransmissions are all lost. The sender will give up and release the connection,
while the other side knows nothing at all about the attempts to disconnect and is
still fully active. This situation results in a half-open connection.
We could have avoided this problem by not allowing the sender to give up
after N retries and forcing it to go on forever until it gets a response. However, if
the other side is allowed to time out, the sender will indeed go on forever, because
no response will ever be forthcoming. If we do not allow the receiving side to
time out, the protocol hangs in Fig. 6-14(d).
One way to kill off half-open connections is to have a rule saying that if no
segments have arrived for a certain number of seconds, the connection is automat-
ically disconnected. That way, if one side ever disconnects, the other side will
detect the lack of activity and also disconnect. This rule also takes care of the
case where the connection is broken (because the network can no longer deliver
packets between the hosts) without either end disconnecting first. Of course, if
this rule is introduced, it is necessary for each transport entity to have a timer that
is stopped and then restarted whenever a segment is sent. If this timer expires, a

dummy segment is transmitted, just to keep the other side from disconnecting. On
the other hand, if the automatic disconnect rule is used and too many dummy seg-
ments in a row are lost on an otherwise idle connection, first one side, then the
other will automatically disconnect.
We will not belabor this point any more, but by now it should be clear that
releasing a connection without data loss is not nearly as simple as it first appears.
The lesson here is that the transport user must be involved in deciding when to

disconnect—the problem cannot be cleanly solved by the transport entities them-
selves. To see the importance of the application, consider that while TCP nor-
mally does a symmetric close (with each side independently closing its half of the
connection with a FIN packet when it has sent its data), many Web servers send
the client a RST packet that causes an abrupt close of the connection that is more
like an asymmetric close. This works only because the Web server knows the pat-
tern of data exchange. First it receives a request from the client, which is all the
data the client will send, and then it sends a response to the client. When the Web
server is finished with its response, all of the data has been sent in either direction.
The server can send the client a warning and abruptly shut the connection. If the
client gets this warning, it will release its connection state then and there. If the
client does not get the warning, it will eventually realize that the server is no long-
er talking to it and release the connection state. The data has been successfully
transferred in either case.
6.2.4 Error Control and Flow Control
Having examined connection establishment and release in some detail, let us
now look at how connections are managed while they are in use. The key issues
are error control and flow control. Error control is ensuring that the data is deliv-
ered with the desired level of reliability, usually that all of the data is delivered
without any errors. Flow control is keeping a fast transmitter from overrunning a
slow receiver.
Both of these issues have come up before, when we studied the data link
layer. The solutions that are used at the transport layer are the same mechanisms
that we studied in Chap. 3. As a very brief recap:
1. A frame carries an error-detecting code (e.g., a CRC or checksum)
that is used to check if the information was correctly received.
2. A frame carries a sequence number to identify itself and is retrans-
mitted by the sender until it receives an acknowledgement of suc-
cessful receipt from the receiver. This is called ARQ (Automatic
Repeat reQuest).
3. There is a maximum number of frames that the sender will allow to
be outstanding at any time, pausing if the receiver is not acknowledg-
ing frames quickly enough. If this maximum is one packet the proto-
col is called stop-and-wait. Larger windows enable pipelining and
improve performance on long, fast links.
4. The sliding window protocol combines these features and is also
used to support bidirectional data transfer.
Given that these mechanisms are used on frames at the link layer, it is natural
to wonder why they would be used on segments at the transport layer as well.

---

ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS
523
However, there is little duplication between the link and transport layers in prac-
tice. Even though the same mechanisms are used, there are differences in function
and degree.
For a difference in function, consider error detection. The link layer check-
sum protects a frame while it crosses a single link. The transport layer checksum
protects a segment while it crosses an entire network path. It is an end-to-end
check, which is not the same as having a check on every link. Saltzer et al. (1984)
describe a situation in which packets were corrupted inside a router. The link
layer checksums protected the packets only while they traveled across a link, not
while they were inside the router. Thus, packets were delivered incorrectly even
though they were correct according to the checks on every link.
This and other examples led Saltzer et al. to articulate the end-to-end argu-
ment. According to this argument, the transport layer check that runs end-to-end
is essential for correctness, and the link layer checks are not essential but nonethe-
less valuable for improving performance (since without them a corrupted packet
can be sent along the entire path unnecessarily).
As a difference in degree, consider retransmissions and the sliding window
protocol. Most wireless links, other than satellite links, can have only a single
frame outstanding from the sender at a time. That is, the bandwidth-delay product
for the link is small enough that not even a whole frame can be stored inside the
link. In this case, a small window size is sufficient for good performance. For ex-
ample, 802.11 uses a stop-and-wait protocol, transmitting or retransmitting each
frame and waiting for it to be acknowledged before moving on to the next frame.
Having a window size larger than one frame would add complexity without im-
proving performance. For wired and optical fiber links, such as (switched) Ether-
net or ISP backbones, the error-rate is low enough that link-layer retransmissions
can be omitted because the end-to-end retransmissions will repair the residual
frame loss.
On the other hand, many TCP connections have a bandwidth-delay product
that is much larger than a single segment. Consider a connection sending data a-
cross the U.S. at 1 Mbps with a round-trip time of 100 msec. Even for this slow
connection, 200 Kbit of data will be stored at the receiver in the time it takes to
send a segment and receive an acknowledgement. For these situations, a large
sliding window must be used. Stop-and-wait will cripple performance. In our ex-
ample it would limit performance to one segment every 200 msec, or 5 seg-
ments/sec no matter how fast the network really is.
Given that transport protocols generally use larger sliding windows, we will
look at the issue of buffering data more carefully. Since a host may have many
connections, each of which is treated separately, it may need a substantial amount
of buffering for the sliding windows. The buffers are needed at both the sender
and the receiver. Certainly they are needed at the sender to hold all transmitted
but as yet unacknowledged segments. They are needed there because these seg-
ments may be lost and need to be retransmitted.

---

THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
However, since the sender is buffering, the receiver may or may not dedicate
specific buffers to specific connections, as it sees fit. The receiver may, for ex-
ample, maintain a single buffer pool shared by all connections. When a segment
comes in, an attempt is made to dynamically acquire a new buffer. If one is avail-
able, the segment is accepted; otherwise, it is discarded. Since the sender is pre-
pared to retransmit segments lost by the network, no permanent harm is done by
having the receiver drop segments, although some resources are wasted. The
sender just keeps trying until it gets an acknowledgement.
The best trade-off between source buffering and destination buffering depends
on the type of traffic carried by the connection. For low-bandwidth bursty traffic,
such as that produced by an interactive terminal, it is reasonable not to dedicate
any buffers, but rather to acquire them dynamically at both ends, relying on buff-
ering at the sender if segments must occasionally be discarded. On the other
hand, for file transfer and other high-bandwidth traffic, it is better if the receiver
does dedicate a full window of buffers, to allow the data to flow at maximum
speed. This is the strategy that TCP uses.
There still remains the question of how to organize the buffer pool. If most
segments are nearly the same size, it is natural to organize the buffers as a pool of
identically sized buffers, with one segment per buffer, as in Fig. 6-15(a). Howev-
er, if there is wide variation in segment size, from short requests for Web pages to
large packets in peer-to-peer file transfers, a pool of fixed-sized buffers presents
problems. If the buffer size is chosen to be equal to the largest possible segment,
space will be wasted whenever a short segment arrives. If the buffer size is cho-
sen to be less than the maximum segment size, multiple buffers will be needed for
long segments, with the attendant complexity.
Another approach to the buffer size problem is to use variable-sized buffers,
as in Fig. 6-15(b). The advantage here is better memory utilization, at the price of
more complicated buffer management. A third possibility is to dedicate a single
large circular buffer per connection, as in Fig. 6-15(c). This system is simple and
elegant and does not depend on segment sizes, but makes good use of memory
only when the connections are heavily loaded.
As connections are opened and closed and as the traffic pattern changes, the
sender and receiver need to dynamically adjust their buffer allocations. Conse-
quently, the transport protocol should allow a sending host to request buffer space
at the other end. Buffers could be allocated per connection, or collectively, for all
the connections running between the two hosts. Alternatively, the receiver, know-
ing its buffer situation (but not knowing the offered traffic) could tell the sender
‘‘I have reserved X buffers for you.’’ If the number of open connections should in-
crease, it may be necessary for an allocation to be reduced, so the protocol should
provide for this possibility.
A reasonably general way to manage dynamic buffer allocation is to decouple
the buffering from the acknowledgements, in contrast to the sliding window pro-
tocols of Chap. 3. Dynamic buffer management means, in effect, a variable-sized

window. Initially, the sender requests a certain number of buffers, based on its
expected needs. The receiver then grants as many of these as it can afford. Every
time the sender transmits a segment, it must decrement its allocation, stopping
altogether when the allocation reaches zero. The receiver separately piggybacks
both acknowledgements and buffer allocations onto the reverse traffic. TCP uses
this scheme, carrying buffer allocations in a header field called Window size.
Figure 6-16 shows an example of how dynamic window management might
work in a datagram network with 4-bit sequence numbers. In this example, data
flows in segments from host A to host B and acknowledgements and buffer alloca-
tions flow in segments in the reverse direction. Initially, A wants eight buffers,
but it is granted only four of these. It then sends three segments, of which the
third is lost. Segment 6 acknowledges receipt of all segments up to and including
sequence number 1, thus allowing A to release those buffers, and furthermore
informs A that it has permission to send three more segments starting beyond 1
(i.e., segments 2, 3, and 4). A knows that it has already sent number 2, so it thinks
that it may send segments 3 and 4, which it proceeds to do. At this point it is
blocked and must wait for more buffer allocation. Timeout-induced retransmis-
sions (line 9), however, may occur while blocked, since they use buffers that have
already been allocated. In line 10, B acknowledges receipt of all segments up to
and including 4 but refuses to let A continue. Such a situation is impossible with
the fixed-window protocols of Chap. 3. The next segment from B to A allocates

another buffer and allows A to continue. This will happen when B has buffer
space, likely because the transport user has accepted more segment data.

The arrows show the direction of

Problems with buffer allocation schemes of this kind can arise in datagram
networks if control segments can get lost—which they most certainly can. Look
at line 16. B has now allocated more buffers to A, but the allocation segment was
lost. Oops. Since control segments are not sequenced or timed out, A is now
deadlocked. To prevent this situation, each host should periodically send control
segments giving the acknowledgement and buffer status on each connection. That
way, the deadlock will be broken, sooner or later.
Until now we have tacitly assumed that the only limit imposed on the sender’s
data rate is the amount of buffer space available in the receiver. This is often not
the case. Memory was once expensive but prices have fallen dramatically. Hosts
may be equipped with sufficient memory that the lack of buffers is rarely, if ever,
a problem, even for wide area connections. Of course, this depends on the buffer
size being set to be large enough, which has not always been the case for TCP
(Zhang et al., 2002).
When buffer space no longer limits the maximum flow, another bottleneck
will appear: the carrying capacity of the network. If adjacent routers can ex-
change at most x packets/sec and there are k disjoint paths between a pair of hosts,
there is no way that those hosts can exchange more than kx segments/sec, no mat-
ter how much buffer space is available at each end. If the sender pushes too hard

(i.e., sends more than kx segments/sec), the network will become congested be-
cause it will be unable to deliver segments as fast as they are coming in.
What is needed is a mechanism that limits transmissions from the sender
based on the network’s carrying capacity rather than on the receiver’s buffering
capacity. Belsnes (1975) proposed using a sliding window flow-control scheme
in which the sender dynamically adjusts the window size to match the network’s
carrying capacity. This means that a dynamic sliding window can implement both
flow control and congestion control. If the network can handle c segments/sec
and the round-trip time (including transmission, propagation, queueing, proc-
essing at the receiver, and return of the acknowledgement) is r, the sender’s win-
dow should be cr. With a window of this size, the sender normally operates with
the pipeline full. Any small decrease in network performance will cause it to
block. Since the network capacity available to any given flow varies over time,
the window size should be adjusted frequently, to track changes in the carrying
capacity. As we will see later, TCP uses a similar scheme.
6.2.5 Multiplexing
Multiplexing, or sharing several conversations over connections, virtual cir-
cuits, and physical links plays a role in several layers of the network architecture.
In the transport layer, the need for multiplexing can arise in a number of ways.
For example, if only one network address is available on a host, all transport con-
nections on that machine have to use it. When a segment comes in, some way is
needed to tell which process to give it to. This situation, called multiplexing, is
shown in Fig. 6-17(a). In this figure, four distinct transport connections all use the
same network connection (e.g., IP address) to the remote host.
Multiplexing can also be useful in the transport layer for another reason. Sup-
pose, for example, that a host has multiple network paths that it can use. If a user
needs more bandwidth or more reliability than one of the network paths can pro-
vide, a way out is to have a connection that distributes the traffic among multiple
network paths on a round-robin basis, as indicated in Fig. 6-17(b). This modus
operandi is called inverse multiplexing. With k network connections open, the
effective bandwidth might be increased by a factor of k. An example of inverse
multiplexing is SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol), which can run
a connection using multiple network interfaces. In contrast, TCP uses a single net-
work endpoint. Inverse multiplexing is also found at the link layer, when several
low-rate links are used in parallel as one high-rate link.
6.2.6 Crash Recovery
If hosts and routers are subject to crashes or connections are long-lived (e.g.,
large software or media downloads), recovery from these crashes becomes an
issue. If the transport entity is entirely within the hosts, recovery from network

and router crashes is straightforward. The transport entities expect lost segments
all the time and know how to cope with them by using retransmissions.
A more troublesome problem is how to recover from host crashes. In particu-
lar, it may be desirable for clients to be able to continue working when servers
crash and quickly reboot. To illustrate the difficulty, let us assume that one host,
the client, is sending a long file to another host, the file server, using a simple
stop-and-wait protocol. The transport layer on the server just passes the incoming
segments to the transport user, one by one. Partway through the transmission, the
server crashes. When it comes back up, its tables are reinitialized, so it no longer
knows precisely where it was.
In an attempt to recover its previous status, the server might send a broadcast
segment to all other hosts, announcing that it has just crashed and requesting that
its clients inform it of the status of all open connections. Each client can be in one
of two states: one segment outstanding, S1, or no segments outstanding, S0.
Based on only this state information, the client must decide whether to retransmit
the most recent segment.
At first glance, it would seem obvious: the client should retransmit if and only
if it has an unacknowledged segment outstanding (i.e., is in state S1) when it
learns of the crash. However, a closer inspection reveals difficulties with this
naive approach. Consider, for example, the situation in which the server’s tran-
sport entity first sends an acknowledgement and then, when the acknowledgement
has been sent, writes to the application process. Writing a segment onto the out-
put stream and sending an acknowledgement are two distinct events that cannot
be done simultaneously. If a crash occurs after the acknowledgement has been
sent but before the write has been fully completed, the client will receive the

---

## Page 35

SEC. 6.2
ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS
529
acknowledgement and thus be in state S0 when the crash recovery announcement
arrives. The client will therefore not retransmit, (incorrectly) thinking that the
segment has arrived. This decision by the client leads to a missing segment.
At this point you may be thinking: ‘‘That problem can be solved easily. All
you have to do is reprogram the transport entity to first do the write and then send
the acknowledgement.’’ Try again. Imagine that the write has been done but the
crash occurs before the acknowledgement can be sent. The client will be in state
S1 and thus retransmit, leading to an undetected duplicate segment in the output
stream to the server application process.
No matter how the client and server are programmed, there are always situa-
tions where the protocol fails to recover properly. The server can be programmed
in one of two ways: acknowledge first or write first. The client can be pro-
grammed in one of four ways: always retransmit the last segment, never retrans-
mit the last segment, retransmit only in state S0, or retransmit only in state S1.
This gives eight combinations, but as we shall see, for each combination there is
some set of events that makes the protocol fail.
Three events are possible at the server: sending an acknowledgement (A),
writing to the output process (W), and crashing (C). The three events can occur
in six different orderings: AC(W), AWC, C(AW), C(WA), WAC, and WC(A),
where the parentheses are used to indicate that neither A nor W can follow C (i.e.,
once it has crashed, it has crashed). Figure 6-18 shows all eight combinations of
client and server strategies and the valid event sequences for each one. Notice
that for each strategy there is some sequence of events that causes the protocol to
fail. For example, if the client always retransmits, the AWC event will generate
an undetected duplicate, even though the other two events work properly.

CHAP. 6
Making the protocol more elaborate does not help. Even if the client and ser-
ver exchange several segments before the server attempts to write, so that the cli-
ent knows exactly what is about to happen, the client has no way of knowing
whether a crash occurred just before or just after the write. The conclusion is
inescapable: under our ground rules of no simultaneous events—that is, separate
events happen one after another not at the same time—host crash and recovery
cannot be made transparent to higher layers.
Put in more general terms, this result can be restated as ‘‘recovery from a
layer N crash can only be done by layer N + 1,’’ and then only if the higher layer
retains enough status information to reconstruct where it was before the problem
occurred. This is consistent with the case mentioned above that the transport
layer can recover from failures in the network layer, provided that each end of a
connection keeps track of where it is.
This problem gets us into the issue of what a so-called end-to-end acknowl-
edgement really means. In principle, the transport protocol is end-to-end and not
chained like the lower layers. Now consider the case of a user entering requests
for transactions against a remote database. Suppose that the remote transport enti-
ty is programmed to first pass segments to the next layer up and then acknow-
ledge. Even in this case, the receipt of an acknowledgement back at the user’s
machine does not necessarily mean that the remote host stayed up long enough to
actually update the database. A truly end-to-end acknowledgement, whose receipt
means that the work has actually been done and lack thereof means that it has not,
is probably impossible to achieve. This point is discussed in more detail by
Saltzer et al. (1984).
6.3 CONGESTION CONTROL
If the transport entities on many machines send too many packets into the net-
work too quickly, the network will become congested, with performance degraded
as packets are delayed and lost. Controlling congestion to avoid this problem is
the combined responsibility of the network and transport layers. Congestion oc-
curs at routers, so it is detected at the network layer. However, congestion is ulti-
mately caused by traffic sent into the network by the transport layer. The only ef-
fective way to control congestion is for the transport protocols to send packets
into the network more slowly.
In Chap. 5, we studied congestion control mechanisms in the network layer.
In this section, we will study the other half of the problem, congestion control
mechanisms in the transport layer. After describing the goals of congestion con-
trol, we will describe how hosts can regulate the rate at which they send packets
into the network. The Internet relies heavily on the transport layer for congestion
control, and specific algorithms are built into TCP and other protocols.

6.3.1 Desirable Bandwidth Allocation
Before we describe how to regulate traffic, we must understand what we are
trying to achieve by running a congestion control algorithm. That is, we must
specify the state in which a good congestion control algorithm will operate the
network. The goal is more than to simply avoid congestion. It is to find a good al-
location of bandwidth to the transport entities that are using the network. A good
allocation will deliver good performance because it uses all the available band-
width but avoids congestion, it will be fair across competing transport entities, and
it will quickly track changes in traffic demands. We will make each of these cri-
teria more precise in turn.
Efficiency and Power
An efficient allocation of bandwidth across transport entities will use all of
the network capacity that is available. However, it is not quite right to think that if
there is a 100-Mbps link, five transport entities should get 20 Mbps each. They
should usually get less than 20 Mbps for good performance. The reason is that the
traffic is often bursty. Recall that in Sec. 5.3 we described the goodput (or rate of
useful packets arriving at the receiver) as a function of the offered load. This
curve and a matching curve for the delay as a function of the offered load are
given in Fig. 6-19.

As the load increases in Fig. 6-19(a) goodput initially increases at the same
rate, but as the load approaches the capacity, goodput rises more gradually. This
falloff is because bursts of traffic can occasionally mount up and cause some
losses at buffers inside the network. If the transport protocol is poorly designed
and retransmits packets that have been delayed but not lost, the network can enter
congestion collapse. In this state, senders are furiously sending packets, but in-
creasingly little useful work is being accomplished.

---

## Page 38

532
THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
The corresponding delay is given in Fig. 6-19(b) Initially the delay is fixed,
representing the propagation delay across the network. As the load approaches the
capacity, the delay rises, slowly at first and then much more rapidly. This is again
because of bursts of traffic that tend to mound up at high load. The delay cannot
really go to infinity, except in a model in which the routers have infinite buffers.
Instead, packets will be lost after experiencing the maximum buffering delay.
For both goodput and delay, performance begins to degrade at the onset of
congestion. Intuitively, we will obtain the best performance from the network if
we allocate bandwidth up until the delay starts to climb rapidly. This point is be-
low the capacity. To identify it, Kleinrock (1979) proposed the metric of power,
where
power = delay
load
Power will initially rise with offered load, as delay remains small and roughly
constant, but will reach a maximum and fall as delay grows rapidly. The load with
the highest power represents an efficient load for the transport entity to place on
the network.
Max-Min Fairness
In the preceding discussion, we did not talk about how to divide bandwidth
between different transport senders. This sounds like a simple question to
answer—give all the senders an equal fraction of the bandwidth—but it involves
several considerations.
Perhaps the first consideration is to ask what this problem has to do with con-
gestion control. After all, if the network gives a sender some amount of bandwidth
to use, the sender should just use that much bandwidth. However, it is often the
case that networks do not have a strict bandwidth reservation for each flow or
connection. They may for some flows if quality of service is supported, but many
connections will seek to use whatever bandwidth is available or be lumped toget-
her by the network under a common allocation. For example, IETF’s differentiat-
ed services separates traffic into two classes and connections compete for band-
width within each class. IP routers often have all connections competing for the
same bandwidth. In this situation, it is the congestion control mechanism that is
allocating bandwidth to the competing connections.
A second consideration is what a fair portion means for flows in a network. It
is simple enough if N flows use a single link, in which case they can all have 1/N
of the bandwidth (although efficiency will dictate that they use slightly less if the
traffic is bursty). But what happens if the flows have different, but overlapping,
network paths? For example, one flow may cross three links, and the other flows
may cross one link. The three-link flow consumes more network resources. It
might be fairer in some sense to give it less bandwidth than the one-link flows. It

CONGESTION CONTROL
533
should certainly be possible to support more one-link flows by reducing the band-
width of the three-link flow. This point demonstrates an inherent tension between
fairness and efficiency.
However, we will adopt a notion of fairness that does not depend on the
length of the network path. Even with this simple model, giving connections an
equal fraction of bandwidth is a bit complicated because different connections
will take different paths through the network and these paths will themselves have
different capacities. In this case, it is possible for a flow to be bottlenecked on a
downstream link and take a smaller portion of an upstream link than other flows;
reducing the bandwidth of the other flows would slow them down but would not
help the bottlenecked flow at all.
The form of fairness that is often desired for network usage is max-min fair-
ness. An allocation is max-min fair if the bandwidth given to one flow cannot be
increased without decreasing the bandwidth given to another flow with an alloca-
tion that is no larger. That is, increasing the bandwidth of a flow will only make
the situation worse for flows that are less well off.
Let us see an example. A max-min fair allocation is shown for a network with
four flows, A, B, C, and D, in Fig. 6-20. Each of the links between routers has the
same capacity, taken to be 1 unit, though in the general case the links will have
different capacities. Three flows compete for the bottom-left link between routers
R4 and R5. Each of these flows therefore gets 1/3 of the link. The remaining
flow, A, competes with B on the link from R2 to R3. Since B has an allocation of
1/3, A gets the remaining 2/3 of the link. Notice that all of the other links have
spare capacity. However, this capacity cannot be given to any of the flows without
decreasing the capacity of another, lower flow. For example, if more of the band-
width on the link between R2 and R3 is given to flow B, there will be less for flow
A. This is reasonable as flow A already has more bandwidth. However, the ca-
pacity of flow C or D (or both) must be decreased to give more bandwidth to B,
and these flows will have less bandwidth than B. Thus, the allocation is max-min
fair.

Figure 6-20. Max-min bandwidth allocation for four flows.
Max-min allocations can be computed given a global knowledge of the net-
work. An intuitive way to think about them is to imagine that the rate for all of the

flows starts at zero and is slowly increased. When the rate reaches a bottleneck for
any flow, then that flow stops increasing. The other flows all continue to increase,
sharing equally in the available capacity, until they too reach their respective bot-
tlenecks.
A third consideration is the level over which to consider fairness. A network
could be fair at the level of connections, connections between a pair of hosts, or
all connections per host. We examined this issue when we were discussing WFQ
(Weighted Fair Queueing) in Sec. 5.4 and concluded that each of these definitions
has its problems. For example, defining fairness per host means that a busy server
will fare no better than a mobile phone, while defining fairness per connection
encourages hosts to open more connections. Given that there is no clear answer,
fairness is often considered per connection, but precise fairness is usually not a
concern. It is more important in practice that no connection be starved of band-
width than that all connections get precisely the same amount of bandwidth. In
fact, with TCP it is possible to open multiple connections and compete for band-
width more aggressively. This tactic is used by bandwidth-hungry applications
such as BitTorrent for peer-to-peer file sharing.
Convergence
A final criterion is that the congestion control algorithm converge quickly to a
fair and efficient allocation of bandwidth. The discussion of the desirable operat-
ing point above assumes a static network environment. However, connections are
always coming and going in a network, and the bandwidth needed by a given con-
nection will vary over time too, for example, as a user browses Web pages and
occasionally downloads large videos.
Because of the variation in demand, the ideal operating point for the network
varies over time. A good congestion control algorithm should rapidly converge to
the ideal operating point, and it should track that point as it changes over time. If
the convergence is too slow, the algorithm will never be close to the changing op-
erating point. If the algorithm is not stable, it may fail to converge to the right
point in some cases, or even oscillate around the right point.
An example of a bandwidth allocation that changes over time and converges
quickly is shown in Fig. 6-21. Initially, flow 1 has all of the bandwidth. One sec-
ond later, flow 2 starts. It needs bandwidth as well.
The allocation quickly
changes to give each of these flows half the bandwidth. At 4 seconds, a third flow
joins. However, this flow uses only 20% of the bandwidth, which is less than its
fair share (which is a third). Flows 1 and 2 quickly adjust, dividing the available
bandwidth to each have 40% of the bandwidth. At 9 seconds, the second flow
leaves, and the third flow remains unchanged. The first flow quickly captures 80%
of the bandwidth. At all times, the total allocated bandwidth is approximately
100%, so that the network is fully used, and competing flows get equal treatment
(but do not have to use more bandwidth than they need).

6.3.2 Regulating the Sending Rate
Now it is time for the main course. How do we regulate the sending rates to
obtain a desirable bandwidth allocation? The sending rate may be limited by two
factors. The first is flow control, in the case that there is insufficient buffering at
the receiver. The second is congestion, in the case that there is insufficient capaci-
ty in the network. In Fig. 6-22, we see this problem illustrated hydraulically. In
Fig. 6-22(a), we see a thick pipe leading to a small-capacity receiver. This is a
flow-control limited situation. As long as the sender does not send more water
than the bucket can contain, no water will be lost. In Fig. 6-22(b), the limiting
factor is not the bucket capacity, but the internal carrying capacity of the network.
If too much water comes in too fast, it will back up and some will be lost (in this
case, by overflowing the funnel).
These cases may appear similar to the sender, as transmitting too fast causes
packets to be lost. However, they have different causes and call for different solu-
tions. We have already talked about a flow-control solution with a variable-sized
window. Now we will consider a congestion control solution. Since either of
these problems can occur, the transport protocol will in general need to run both
solutions and slow down if either problem occurs.
The way that a transport protocol should regulate the sending rate depends on
the form of the feedback returned by the network. Different network layers may
return different kinds of feedback. The feedback may be explicit or implicit, and it
may be precise or imprecise.
An example of an explicit, precise design is when routers tell the sources the
rate at which they may send. Designs in the literature such as XCP (eXplicit Con-
gestion Protocol) operate in this manner (Katabi et al., 2002). An explicit, impre-
cise design is the use of ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) with TCP. In this
design, routers set bits on packets that experience congestion to warn the senders
to slow down, but they do not tell them how much to slow down.

In other designs, there is no explicit signal. FAST TCP measures the round-
trip delay and uses that metric as a signal to avoid congestion (Wei et al., 2006).
Finally, in the form of congestion control most prevalent in the Internet today,
TCP with drop-tail or RED routers, packet loss is inferred and used to signal that
the network has become congested. There are many variants of this form of TCP,
including CUBIC TCP, which is used in Linux (Ha et al., 2008). Combinations
are also possible. For example, Windows includes Compound TCP that uses both
packet loss and delay as feedback signals (Tan et al., 2006). These designs are
summarized in Fig. 6-23.
If an explicit and precise signal is given, the transport entity can use that sig-
nal to adjust its rate to the new operating point. For example, if XCP tells senders
the rate to use, the senders may simply use that rate. In the other cases, however,
some guesswork is involved. In the absence of a congestion signal, the senders
should decrease their rates. When a congestion signal is given, the senders should
decrease their rates. The way in which the rates are increased or decreased is
given by a control law. These laws have a major effect on performance.

Figure 6-23. Signals of some congestion control protocols.
Chiu and Jain (1989) studied the case of binary congestion feedback and con-
cluded that AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) is the appropr-
iate control law to arrive at the efficient and fair operating point. To argue this
case, they constructed a graphical argument for the simple case of two con-
nections competing for the bandwidth of a single link. The graph in Fig. 6-24
shows the bandwidth allocated to user 1 on the x-axis and to user 2 on the y-axis.
When the allocation is fair, both users will receive the same amount of bandwidth.
This is shown by the dotted fairness line. When the allocations sum to 100%, the
capacity of the link, the allocation is efficient. This is shown by the dotted effi-
ciency line. A congestion signal is given by the network to both users when the
sum of their allocations crosses this line. The intersection of these lines is the de-
sired operating point, when both users have the same bandwidth and all of the net-
work bandwidth is used.

Consider what happens from some starting allocation if both user 1 and user 2

operating point crosses the efficiency line and both users receive a congestion sig-
nal from the network. At this stage, they must reduce their allocations. However,
an additive decrease would simply cause them to oscillate along an additive line.
This situation is shown in Fig. 6-24. The behavior will keep the operating point
close to efficient, but it will not necessarily be fair.
Similarly, consider the case when both users multiplicatively increase their
bandwidth over time until they receive a congestion signal. For example, the users
may increase their sending rate by 10% every second. If they then multiplica-
tively decrease their sending rates, the operating point of the users will simply
oscillate along a multiplicative line. This behavior is also shown in Fig. 6-24.
The multiplicative line has a different slope than the additive line. (It points to the
origin, while the additive line has an angle of 45 degrees.) But it is otherwise no
better. In neither case will the users converge to the optimal sending rates that are
both fair and efficient.
Now consider the case that the users additively increase their bandwidth al-
locations and then multiplicatively decrease them when congestion is signaled.
This behavior is the AIMD control law, and it is shown in Fig. 6-25. It can be
seen that the path traced by this behavior does converge to the optimal point that
is both fair and efficient. This convergence happens no matter what the starting
point, making AIMD broadly useful. By the same argument, the only other com-
bination, multiplicative increase and additive decrease, would diverge from the
optimal point.

Figure 6-25. Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) control law.
AIMD is the control law that is used by TCP, based on this argument and an-
other stability argument (that it is easy to drive the network into congestion and
difficult to recover, so the increase policy should be gentle and the decrease poli-
cy aggressive). It is not quite fair, since TCP connections adjust their window
size by a given amount every round-trip time. Different connections will have dif-
ferent round-trip times. This leads to a bias in which connections to closer hosts
receive more bandwidth than connections to distant hosts, all else being equal.

CONGESTION CONTROL
539
In Sec. 6.5, we will describe in detail how TCP implements an AIMD control
law to adjust the sending rate and provide congestion control. This task is more
difficult than it sounds because rates are measured over some interval and traffic
is bursty. Instead of adjusting the rate directly, a strategy that is often used in
practice is to adjust the size of a sliding window. TCP uses this strategy. If the
window size is W and the round-trip time is RTT, the equivalent rate is W/RTT.
This strategy is easy to combine with flow control, which already uses a window,
and has the advantage that the sender paces packets using acknowledgements and
hence slows down in one RTT if it stops receiving reports that packets are leaving
the network.
As a final issue, there may be many different transport protocols that send
traffic into the network. What will happen if the different protocols compete with
different control laws to avoid congestion? Unequal bandwidth allocations, that is
what. Since TCP is the dominant form of congestion control in the Internet, there
is significant community pressure for new transport protocols to be designed so
that they compete fairly with it. The early streaming media protocols caused prob-
lems by excessively reducing TCP throughput because they did not compete
fairly. This led to the notion of TCP-friendly congestion control in which TCP
and non-TCP transport protocols can be freely mixed with no ill effects (Floyd et
al., 2000).
6.3.3 Wireless Issues
Transport protocols such as TCP that implement congestion control should be
independent of the underlying network and link layer technologies. That is a good
theory, but in practice there are issues with wireless networks. The main issue is
that packet loss is often used as a congestion signal, including by TCP as we have
just discussed. Wireless networks lose packets all the time due to transmission er-
rors.
With the AIMD control law, high throughput requires very small levels of
packet loss. Analyses by Padhye et al. (1998) show that the throughput goes up as
the inverse square-root of the packet loss rate. What this means in practice is that
the loss rate for fast TCP connections is very small; 1% is a moderate loss rate,
and by the time the loss rate reaches 10% the connection has effectively stopped
working. However, for wireless networks such as 802.11 LANs, frame loss rates
of at least 10% are common. This difference means that, absent protective meas-
ures, congestion control schemes that use packet loss as a signal will unneces-
sarily throttle connections that run over wireless links to very low rates.
To function well, the only packet losses that the congestion control algorithm
should observe are losses due to insufficient bandwidth, not losses due to trans-
mission errors. One solution to this problem is to mask the wireless losses by
using retransmissions over the wireless link. For example, 802.11 uses a stop-
and-wait protocol to deliver each frame, retrying transmissions multiple times if

need be before reporting a packet loss to the higher layer. In the normal case, each
packet is delivered despite transient transmission errors that are not visible to the
higher layers.
Fig. 6-26 shows a path with a wired and wireless link for which the masking
strategy is used. There are two aspects to note. First, the sender does not neces-
sarily know that the path includes a wireless link, since all it sees is the wired link
to which it is attached. Internet paths are heterogeneous and there is no general
method for the sender to tell what kind of links comprise the path. This compli-
cates the congestion control problem, as there is no easy way to use one protocol
for wireless links and another protocol for wired links.

Figure 6-26. Congestion control over a path with a wireless link.
The second aspect is a puzzle. The figure shows two mechanisms that are
driven by loss: link layer frame retransmissions, and transport layer congestion
control. The puzzle is how these two mechanisms can co-exist without getting
confused. After all, a loss should cause only one mechanism to take action be-
cause it is either a transmission error or a congestion signal. It cannot be both. If
both mechanisms take action (by retransmitting the frame and slowing down the
sending rate) then we are back to the original problem of transports that run far
too slowly over wireless links. Consider this puzzle for a moment and see if you
can solve it.
The solution is that the two mechanisms act at different timescales. Link
layer retransmissions happen on the order of microseconds to milliseconds for
wireless links such as 802.11. Loss timers in transport protocols fire on the order
of milliseconds to seconds. The difference is three orders of magnitude. This al-
lows wireless links to detect frame losses and retransmit frames to repair trans-
mission errors long before packet loss is inferred by the transport entity.
The masking strategy is sufficient to let most transport protocols run well
across most wireless links. However, it is not always a fitting solution. Some
wireless links have long round-trip times, such as satellites. For these links other
techniques must be used to mask loss, such as FEC (Forward Error Correction), or
the transport protocol must use a non-loss signal for congestion control.

CONGESTION CONTROL

A second issue with congestion control over wireless links is variable capaci-
ty. That is, the capacity of a wireless link changes over time, sometimes abruptly,
as nodes move and the signal-to-noise ratio varies with the changing channel con-
ditions. This is unlike wired links whose capacity is fixed. The transport protocol
must adapt to the changing capacity of wireless links, otherwise it will either con-
gest the network or fail to use the available capacity.
One possible solution to this problem is simply not to worry about it. This
strategy is feasible because congestion control algorithms must already handle the
case of new users entering the network or existing users changing their sending
rates. Even though the capacity of wired links is fixed, the changing behavior of
other users presents itself as variability in the bandwidth that is available to a
given user. Thus it is possible to simply run TCP over a path with an 802.11 wire-
less link and obtain reasonable performance.
However, when there is much wireless variability, transport protocols de-
signed for wired links may have trouble keeping up and deliver poor performance.
The solution in this case is a transport protocol that is designed for wireless links.
A particularly challenging setting is a wireless mesh network in which multiple,
interfering wireless links must be crossed, routes change due to mobility, and
there is lots of loss. Research in this area is ongoing. See Li et al. (2009) for an
example of wireless transport protocol design.
6.4 THE INTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: UDP
The Internet has two main protocols in the transport layer, a connectionless
protocol and a connection-oriented one. The protocols complement each other.
The connectionless protocol is UDP. It does almost nothing beyond sending pack-
ets between applications, letting applications build their own protocols on top as
needed. The connection-oriented protocol is TCP. It does almost everything. It
makes connections and adds reliability with retransmissions, along with flow con-
trol and congestion control, all on behalf of the applications that use it.
In the following sections, we will study UDP and TCP. We will start with
UDP because it is simplest. We will also look at two uses of UDP. Since UDP is
a transport layer protocol that typically runs in the operating system and protocols
that use UDP typically run in user space, these uses might be considered applica-
tions. However, the techniques they use are useful for many applications and are
better considered to belong to a transport service, so we will cover them here.
6.4.1 Introduction to UDP
The Internet protocol suite supports a connectionless transport protocol called
UDP (User Datagram Protocol). UDP provides a way for applications to send
encapsulated IP datagrams without having to establish a connection. UDP is de-
scribed in RFC 768.

THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
UDP transmits segments consisting of an 8-byte header followed by the pay-
load. The header is shown in Fig. 6-27. The two ports serve to identify the end-
points within the source and destination machines. When a UDP packet arrives,
its payload is handed to the process attached to the destination port. This attach-
ment occurs when the BIND primitive or something similar is used, as we saw in
Fig. 6-6 for TCP (the binding process is the same for UDP). Think of ports as
mailboxes that applications can rent to receive packets. We will have more to say
about them when we describe TCP, which also uses ports. In fact, the main value
of UDP over just using raw IP is the addition of the source and destination ports.
Without the port fields, the transport layer would not know what to do with each
incoming packet. With them, it delivers the embedded segment to the correct ap-
plication.
32 Bits
Source port
UDP length
Destination port
UDP checksum
Figure 6-27. The UDP header.
The source port is primarily needed when a reply must be sent back to the
source. By copying the Source port field from the incoming segment into the
Destination port field of the outgoing segment, the process sending the reply can
specify which process on the sending machine is to get it.
The UDP length field includes the 8-byte header and the data. The minimum
length is 8 bytes, to cover the header. The maximum length is 65,515 bytes, which
is lower than the largest number that will fit in 16 bits because of the size limit on
IP packets.
An optional Checksum is also provided for extra reliability. It checksums the
header, the data, and a conceptual IP pseudoheader. When performing this com-
putation, the Checksum field is set to zero and the data field is padded out with an
additional zero byte if its length is an odd number. The checksum algorithm is
simply to add up all the 16-bit words in one’s complement and to take the one’s
complement of the sum. As a consequence, when the receiver performs the calcu-
lation on the entire segment, including the Checksum field, the result should be 0.
If the checksum is not computed, it is stored as a 0, since by a happy coincidence
of one’s complement arithmetic a true computed 0 is stored as all 1s. However,
turning it off is foolish unless the quality of the data does not matter (e.g., for digi-
tized speech).
The pseudoheader for the case of IPv4 is shown in Fig. 6-28. It contains the
32-bit IPv4 addresses of the source and destination machines, the protocol number
for UDP (17), and the byte count for the UDP segment (including the header). It

is different but analogous for IPv6. Including the pseudoheader in the UDP
checksum computation helps detect misdelivered packets, but including it also
violates the protocol hierarchy since the IP addresses in it belong to the IP layer,
not to the UDP layer. TCP uses the same pseudoheader for its checksum.

It is probably worth mentioning explicitly some of the things that UDP does
not do. It does not do flow control, congestion control, or retransmission upon
receipt of a bad segment. All of that is up to the user processes. What it does do
is provide an interface to the IP protocol with the added feature of demultiplexing
multiple processes using the ports and optional end-to-end error detection. That is
all it does.
For applications that need to have precise control over the packet flow, error
control, or timing, UDP provides just what the doctor ordered. One area where it
is especially useful is in client-server situations. Often, the client sends a short re-
quest to the server and expects a short reply back. If either the request or the
reply is lost, the client can just time out and try again. Not only is the code sim-
ple, but fewer messages are required (one in each direction) than with a protocol
requiring an initial setup like TCP.
An application that uses UDP this way is DNS (Domain Name System),
which we will study in Chap. 7. In brief, a program that needs to look up the IP
address of some host name, for example, www.cs.berkeley.edu, can send a UDP
packet containing the host name to a DNS server. The server replies with a UDP
packet containing the host’s IP address. No setup is needed in advance and no re-
lease is needed afterward. Just two messages go over the network.
6.4.2 Remote Procedure Call
In a certain sense, sending a message to a remote host and getting a reply back
is a lot like making a function call in a programming language. In both cases, you
start with one or more parameters and you get back a result. This observation has
led people to try to arrange request-reply interactions on networks to be cast in the

---

THE TRANSPORT LAYER

form of procedure calls. Such an arrangement makes network applications much
easier to program and more familiar to deal with. For example, just imagine a
procedure named get IP address (host name) that works by sending a UDP
packet to a DNS server and waiting for the reply, timing out and trying again if
one is not forthcoming quickly enough. In this way, all the details of networking
can be hidden from the programmer.
The key work in this area was done by Birrell and Nelson (1984). In a nut-
shell, what Birrell and Nelson suggested was allowing programs to call proce-
dures located on remote hosts. When a process on machine 1 calls a procedure on
machine 2, the calling process on 1 is suspended and execution of the called pro-
cedure takes place on 2. Information can be transported from the caller to the cal-
lee in the parameters and can come back in the procedure result. No message pas-
sing is visible to the application programmer. This technique is known as RPC
(Remote Procedure Call) and has become the basis for many networking appli-
cations. Traditionally, the calling procedure is known as the client and the called
procedure is known as the server, and we will use those names here too.
The idea behind RPC is to make a remote procedure call look as much as pos-
sible like a local one. In the simplest form, to call a remote procedure, the client
program must be bound with a small library procedure, called the client stub, that
represents the server procedure in the client’s address space. Similarly, the server
is bound with a procedure called the server stub. These procedures hide the fact
that the procedure call from the client to the server is not local.
The actual steps in making an RPC are shown in Fig. 6-29. Step 1 is the cli-
ent calling the client stub. This call is a local procedure call, with the parameters
pushed onto the stack in the normal way. Step 2 is the client stub packing the pa-
rameters into a message and making a system call to send the message. Packing
the parameters is called marshaling. Step 3 is the operating system sending the
message from the client machine to the server machine. Step 4 is the operating
system passing the incoming packet to the server stub. Finally, step 5 is the server
stub calling the server procedure with the unmarshaled parameters. The reply
traces the same path in the other direction.
The key item to note here is that the client procedure, written by the user, just
makes a normal (i.e., local) procedure call to the client stub, which has the same
name as the server procedure. Since the client procedure and client stub are in the
same address space, the parameters are passed in the usual way. Similarly, the
server procedure is called by a procedure in its address space with the parameters
it expects. To the server procedure, nothing is unusual. In this way, instead of
I/O being done on sockets, network communication is done by faking a normal
procedure call.
Despite the conceptual elegance of RPC, there are a few snakes hiding under
the grass. A big one is the use of pointer parameters. Normally, passing a pointer
to a procedure is not a problem. The called procedure can use the pointer in the
same way the caller can because both procedures live in the same virtual address

space. With RPC, passing pointers is impossible because the client and server are
in different address spaces.
In some cases, tricks can be used to make it possible to pass pointers. Sup-
pose that the first parameter is a pointer to an integer, k. The client stub can
marshal k and send it along to the server. The server stub then creates a pointer to
k and passes it to the server procedure, just as it expects. When the server proce-
dure returns control to the server stub, the latter sends k back to the client, where
the new k is copied over the old one, just in case the server changed it. In effect,
the standard calling sequence of call-by-reference has been replaced by call-by-
copy-restore. Unfortunately, this trick does not always work, for example, if the
pointer points to a graph or other complex data structure. For this reason, some
restrictions must be placed on parameters to procedures called remotely, as we
shall see.
A second problem is that in weakly typed languages, like C, it is perfectly
legal to write a procedure that computes the inner product of two vectors (arrays),
without specifying how large either one is. Each could be terminated by a special
value known only to the calling and called procedures. Under these circum-
stances, it is essentially impossible for the client stub to marshal the parameters: it
has no way of determining how large they are.
A third problem is that it is not always possible to deduce the types of the pa-
rameters, not even from a formal specification or the code itself. An example is
printf, which may have any number of parameters (at least one), and the parame-
ters can be an arbitrary mixture of integers, shorts, longs, characters, strings, float-
ing-point numbers of various lengths, and other types. Trying to call printf as a
remote procedure would be practically impossible because C is so permissive.
However, a rule saying that RPC can be used provided that you do not program in
C (or C++) would not be popular with a lot of programmers.

A fourth problem relates to the use of global variables. Normally, the calling
and called procedure can communicate by using global variables, in addition to
communicating via parameters. But if the called procedure is moved to a remote
machine, the code will fail because the global variables are no longer shared.
These problems are not meant to suggest that RPC is hopeless. In fact, it is
widely used, but some restrictions are needed to make it work well in practice.
In terms of transport layer protocols, UDP is a good base on which to imple-
ment RPC. Both requests and replies may be sent as a single UDP packet in the
simplest case and the operation can be fast. However, an implementation must in-
clude other machinery as well. Because the request or the reply may be lost, the
client must keep a timer to retransmit the request. Note that a reply serves as an
implicit acknowledgement for a request, so the request need not be separately
acknowledged. Sometimes the parameters or results may be larger than the maxi-
mum UDP packet size, in which case some protocol is needed to deliver large
messages. If multiple requests and replies can overlap (as in the case of concur-
rent programming), an identifier is needed to match the request with the reply.
A higher-level concern is that the operation may not be idempotent (i.e., safe
to repeat). The simple case is idempotent operations such as DNS requests and
replies. The client can safely retransmit these requests again and again if no
replies are forthcoming. It does not matter whether the server never received the
request, or it was the reply that was lost. The answer, when it finally arrives, will
be the same (assuming the DNS database is not updated in the meantime). How-
ever, not all operations are idempotent, for example, because they have important
side-effects such as incrementing a counter. RPC for these operations requires
stronger semantics so that when the programmer calls a procedure it is not exe-
cuted multiple times. In this case, it may be necessary to set up a TCP connection
and send the request over it rather than using UDP.
6.4.3 Real-Time Transport Protocols
Client-server RPC is one area in which UDP is widely used. Another one is
for real-time multimedia applications. In particular, as Internet radio, Internet te-
lephony, music-on-demand, videoconferencing, video-on-demand, and other mul-
timedia applications became more commonplace, people have discovered that
each application was reinventing more or less the same real-time transport proto-
col. It gradually became clear that having a generic real-time transport protocol
for multiple applications would be a good idea.
Thus was RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) born. It is described in RFC
3550 and is now in widespread use for multimedia applications. We will describe
two aspects of real-time transport. The first is the RTP protocol for transporting
audio and video data in packets. The second is the processing that takes place,
mostly at the receiver, to play out the audio and video at the right time. These
functions fit into the protocol stack as shown in Fig. 6-30.

RTP normally runs in user space over UDP (in the operating system). It oper-
ates as follows. The multimedia application consists of multiple audio, video,
text, and possibly other streams. These are fed into the RTP library, which is in
user space along with the application. This library multiplexes the streams and
encodes them in RTP packets, which it stuffs into a socket. On the operating sys-
tem side of the socket, UDP packets are generated to wrap the RTP packets and
handed to IP for transmission over a link such as Ethernet. The reverse process
happens at the receiver. The multimedia application eventually receives multi-
media data from the RTP library. It is responsible for playing out the media. The
protocol stack for this situation is shown in Fig. 6-30(a). The packet nesting is
shown in Fig. 6-30(b).
As a consequence of this design, it is a little hard to say which layer RTP is
in. Since it runs in user space and is linked to the application program, it certainly
looks like an application protocol. On the other hand, it is a generic, application-
independent protocol that just provides transport facilities, so it also looks like a
transport protocol. Probably the best description is that it is a transport protocol
that just happens to be implemented in the application layer, which is why we are
covering it in this chapter.
RTP—The Real-time Transport Protocol
The basic function of RTP is to multiplex several real-time data streams onto
a single stream of UDP packets. The UDP stream can be sent to a single destina-
tion (unicasting) or to multiple destinations (multicasting). Because RTP just uses
normal UDP, its packets are not treated specially by the routers unless some nor-
mal IP quality-of-service features are enabled. In particular, there are no special
guarantees about delivery, and packets may be lost, delayed, corrupted, etc.
The RTP format contains several features to help receivers work with multi-
media information. Each packet sent in an RTP stream is given a number one

---

higher than its predecessor. This numbering allows the destination to determine if
any packets are missing. If a packet is missing, the best action for the destination
to take is up to the application. It may be to skip a video frame if the packets are
carrying video data, or to approximate the missing value by interpolation if the
packets are carrying audio data. Retransmission is not a practical option since the
retransmitted packet would probably arrive too late to be useful. As a conse-
quence, RTP has no acknowledgements, and no mechanism to request retransmis-
sions.
Each RTP payload may contain multiple samples, and they may be coded any
way that the application wants. To allow for interworking, RTP defines several
profiles (e.g., a single audio stream), and for each profile, multiple encoding for-
mats may be allowed. For example, a single audio stream may be encoded as 8-
bit PCM samples at 8 kHz using delta encoding, predictive encoding, GSM en-
coding, MP3 encoding, and so on. RTP provides a header field in which the
source can specify the encoding but is otherwise not involved in how encoding is
done.
Another facility many real-time applications need is timestamping. The idea
here is to allow the source to associate a timestamp with the first sample in each
packet. The timestamps are relative to the start of the stream, so only the dif-
ferences between timestamps are significant. The absolute values have no mean-
ing. As we will describe shortly, this mechanism allows the destination to do a
small amount of buffering and play each sample the right number of milliseconds
after the start of the stream, independently of when the packet containing the sam-
ple arrived.
Not only does timestamping reduce the effects of variation in network delay,
but it also allows multiple streams to be synchronized with each other. For ex-
ample, a digital television program might have a video stream and two audio
streams. The two audio streams could be for stereo broadcasts or for handling
films with an original language soundtrack and a soundtrack dubbed into the local
language, giving the viewer a choice. Each stream comes from a different physi-
cal device, but if they are timestamped from a single counter, they can be played
back synchronously, even if the streams are transmitted and/or received somewhat
erratically.
The RTP header is illustrated in Fig. 6-31. It consists of three 32-bit words
and potentially some extensions. The first word contains the Version field, which
is already at 2. Let us hope this version is very close to the ultimate version since
there is only one code point left (although 3 could be defined as meaning that the
real version was in an extension word).
The P bit indicates that the packet has been padded to a multiple of 4 bytes.
The last padding byte tells how many bytes were added. The X bit indicates that
an extension header is present. The format and meaning of the extension header
are not defined. The only thing that is defined is that the first word of the exten-
sion gives the length. This is an escape hatch for any unforeseen requirements.

The CC field tells how many contributing sources are present, from 0 to 15
(see below). The M bit is an application-specific marker bit. It can be used to
mark the start of a video frame, the start of a word in an audio channel, or some-
thing else that the application understands. The Payload type field tells which en-
coding algorithm has been used (e.g., uncompressed 8-bit audio, MP3, etc.).
Since every packet carries this field, the encoding can change during transmission.
The Sequence number is just a counter that is incremented on each RTP packet
sent. It is used to detect lost packets.
The Timestamp is produced by the stream’s source to note when the first sam-
ple in the packet was made. This value can help reduce timing variability called
jitter at the receiver by decoupling the playback from the packet arrival time. The
Synchronization source identifier tells which stream the packet belongs to. It is
the method used to multiplex and demultiplex multiple data streams onto a single
stream of UDP packets. Finally, the Contributing source identifiers, if any, are
used when mixers are present in the studio. In that case, the mixer is the syn-
chronizing source, and the streams being mixed are listed here.
RTCP—The Real-time Transport Control Protocol
RTP has a little sister protocol (little sibling protocol?) called RTCP (Real-
time Transport Control Protocol). It is defined along with RTP in RFC 3550
and handles feedback, synchronization, and the user interface. It does not tran-
sport any media samples.
The first function can be used to provide feedback on delay, variation in delay
or jitter, bandwidth, congestion, and other network properties to the sources. This
information can be used by the encoding process to increase the data rate (and
give better quality) when the network is functioning well and to cut back the data

rate when there is trouble in the network. By providing continuous feedback, the
encoding algorithms can be continuously adapted to provide the best quality pos-
sible under the current circumstances. For example, if the bandwidth increases or
decreases during the transmission, the encoding may switch from MP3 to 8-bit
PCM to delta encoding as required. The Payload type field is used to tell the dest-
ination what encoding algorithm is used for the current packet, making it possible
to vary it on demand.
An issue with providing feedback is that the RTCP reports are sent to all par-
ticipants. For a multicast application with a large group, the bandwidth used by
RTCP would quickly grow large. To prevent this from happening, RTCP senders
scale down the rate of their reports to collectively consume no more than, say, 5%
of the media bandwidth. To do this, each participant needs to know the media
bandwidth, which it learns from the sender, and the number of participants, which
it estimates by listening to other RTCP reports.
RTCP also handles interstream synchronization. The problem is that different
streams may use different clocks, with different granularities and different drift
rates. RTCP can be used to keep them in sync.
Finally, RTCP provides a way for naming the various sources (e.g., in ASCII
text). This information can be displayed on the receiver’s screen to indicate who
is talking at the moment.
More information about RTP can be found in Perkins (2003).
Playout with Buffering and Jitter Control
Once the media information reaches the receiver, it must be played out at the
right time. In general, this will not be the time at which the RTP packet arrived at
the receiver because packets will take slightly different amounts of time to transit
the network. Even if the packets are injected with exactly the right intervals be-
tween them at the sender, they will reach the receiver with different relative
times. This variation in delay is called jitter. Even a small amount of packet jitter
can cause distracting media artifacts, such as jerky video frames and unintelligible
audio, if the media is simply played out as it arrives.
The solution to this problem is to buffer packets at the receiver before they
are played out to reduce the jitter. As an example, in Fig. 6-32 we see a stream of
packets being delivered with a substantial amount of jitter. Packet 1 is sent from
the server at t = 0 sec and arrives at the client at t = 1 sec. Packet 2 undergoes
more delay and takes 2 sec to arrive. As the packets arrive, they are buffered on
the client machine.
At t = 10 sec, playback begins. At this time, packets 1 through 6 have been
buffered so that they can be removed from the buffer at uniform intervals for
smooth play. In the general case, it is not necessary to use uniform intervals be-
cause the RTP timestamps tell when the media should be played.

Unfortunately, we can see that packet 8 has been delayed so much that it is
not available when its play slot comes up. There are two options. Packet 8 can be
skipped and the player can move on to subsequent packets. Alternatively, play-
back can stop until packet 8 arrives, creating an annoying gap in the music or
movie. In a live media application like a voice-over-IP call, the packet will typi-
cally be skipped. Live applications do not work well on hold. In a streaming me-
dia application, the player might pause. This problem can be alleviated by delay-
ing the starting time even more, by using a larger buffer. For a streaming audio or
video player, buffers of about 10 seconds are often used to ensure that the player
receives all of the packets (that are not dropped in the network) in time. For live
applications like videoconferencing, short buffers are needed for responsiveness.
A key consideration for smooth playout is the playback point, or how long to
wait at the receiver for media before playing it out. Deciding how long to wait
depends on the jitter. The difference between a low-jitter and high-jitter con-
nection is shown in Fig. 6-33. The average delay may not differ greatly between
the two, but if there is high jitter the playback point may need to be much further
out to capture 99% of the packets than if there is low jitter.
To pick a good playback point, the application can measure the jitter by look-
ing at the difference between the RTP timestamps and the arrival time. Each dif-
ference gives a sample of the delay (plus an arbitrary, fixed offset). However, the
delay can change over time due to other, competing traffic and changing routes.
To accommodate this change, applications can adapt their playback point while
they are running. However, if not done well, changing the playback point can pro-
duce an observable glitch to the user. One way to avoid this problem for audio is
to adapt the playback point between talkspurts, in the gaps in a conversation. No
one will notice the difference between a short and slightly longer silence. RTP
lets applications set the M marker bit to indicate the start of a new talkspurt for
this purpose.
If the absolute delay until media is played out is too long, live applications
will suffer. Nothing can be done to reduce the propagation delay if a direct path is

already being used. The playback point can be pulled in by simply accepting that
a larger fraction of packets will arrive too late to be played. If this is not ac-
ceptable, the only way to pull in the playback point is to reduce the jitter by using
a better quality of service, for example, the expedited forwarding differentiated
service. That is, a better network is needed.
6.5 THE INTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP
UDP is a simple protocol and it has some very important uses, such as client-
server interactions and multimedia, but for most Internet applications, reliable, se-
quenced delivery is needed. UDP cannot provide this, so another protocol is re-
quired. It is called TCP and is the main workhorse of the Internet. Let us now
study it in detail.
6.5.1 Introduction to TCP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) was specifically designed to provide
a reliable end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork. An internet-
work differs from a single network because different parts may have wildly dif-
ferent topologies, bandwidths, delays, packet sizes, and other parameters. TCP
was designed to dynamically adapt to properties of the internetwork and to be
robust in the face of many kinds of failures.
TCP was formally defined in RFC 793 in September 1981. As time went on,
many improvements have been made, and various errors and inconsistencies have
been fixed. To give you a sense of the extent of TCP, the important RFCs are

now RFC 793 plus: clarifications and bug fixes in RFC 1122; extensions for
high-performance in RFC 1323; selective acknowledgements in RFC 2018; con-
gestion control in RFC 2581; repurposing of header fields for quality of service in
RFC 2873; improved retransmission timers in RFC 2988; and explicit congestion
notification in RFC 3168. The full collection is even larger, which led to a guide
to the many RFCs, published of course as another RFC document, RFC 4614.
Each machine supporting TCP has a TCP transport entity, either a library pro-
cedure, a user process, or most commonly part of the kernel. In all cases, it man-
ages TCP streams and interfaces to the IP layer. A TCP entity accepts user data
streams from local processes, breaks them up into pieces not exceeding 64 KB (in
practice, often 1460 data bytes in order to fit in a single Ethernet frame with the
IP and TCP headers), and sends each piece as a separate IP datagram. When
datagrams containing TCP data arrive at a machine, they are given to the TCP en-
tity, which reconstructs the original byte streams. For simplicity, we will some-
times use just ‘‘TCP’’ to mean the TCP transport entity (a piece of software) or
the TCP protocol (a set of rules). From the context it will be clear which is meant.
For example, in ‘‘The user gives TCP the data,’’ the TCP transport entity is clear-
ly intended.
The IP layer gives no guarantee that datagrams will be delivered properly, nor
any indication of how fast datagrams may be sent. It is up to TCP to send data-
grams fast enough to make use of the capacity but not cause congestion, and to
time out and retransmit any datagrams that are not delivered. Datagrams that do
arrive may well do so in the wrong order; it is also up to TCP to reassemble them
into messages in the proper sequence. In short, TCP must furnish good per-
formance with the reliability that most applications want and that IP does not pro-
vide.
6.5.2 The TCP Service Model
TCP service is obtained by both the sender and the receiver creating end
points, called sockets, as discussed in Sec. 6.1.3. Each socket has a socket num-
ber (address) consisting of the IP address of the host and a 16-bit number local to
that host, called a port. A port is the TCP name for a TSAP. For TCP service to
be obtained, a connection must be explicitly established between a socket on one
machine and a socket on another machine. The socket calls are listed in Fig. 6-5.
A socket may be used for multiple connections at the same time. In other
words, two or more connections may terminate at the same socket. Connections
are identified by the socket identifiers at both ends, that is, (socket1, socket2). No
virtual circuit numbers or other identifiers are used.
Port numbers below 1024 are reserved for standard services that can usually
only be started by privileged users (e.g., root in UNIX systems). They are called
well-known ports. For example, any process wishing to remotely retrieve mail
from a host can connect to the destination host’s port 143 to contact its IMAP

Other ports from 1024 through 49151 can be registered with IANA for use by
unprivileged users, but applications can and do choose their own ports. For ex-
ample, the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file-sharing application (unofficially) uses
ports 6881–6887, but may run on other ports as well.
It would certainly be possible to have the FTP daemon attach itself to port 21
at boot time, the SSH daemon attach itself to port 22 at boot time, and so on.
However, doing so would clutter up memory with daemons that were idle most of
the time. Instead, what is commonly done is to have a single daemon, called
inetd (Internet daemon) in UNIX, attach itself to multiple ports and wait for the
first incoming connection. When that occurs, inetd forks off a new process and
executes the appropriate daemon in it, letting that daemon handle the request. In
this way, the daemons other than inetd are only active when there is work for
them to do. Inetd learns which ports it is to use from a configuration file. Conse-
quently, the system administrator can set up the system to have permanent dae-
mons on the busiest ports (e.g., port 80) and inetd on the rest.
All TCP connections are full duplex and point-to-point. Full duplex means
that traffic can go in both directions at the same time. Point-to-point means that
each connection has exactly two end points. TCP does not support multicasting or
broadcasting.
A TCP connection is a byte stream, not a message stream. Message bound-
aries are not preserved end to end. For example, if the sending process does four
512-byte writes to a TCP stream, these data may be delivered to the receiving
process as four 512-byte chunks, two 1024-byte chunks, one 2048-byte chunk (see
Fig. 6-35), or some other way. There is no way for the receiver to detect the
unit(s) in which the data were written, no matter how hard it tries.

Files in UNIX have this property too. The reader of a file cannot tell whether
the file was written a block at a time, a byte at a time, or all in one blow. As with
a UNIX file, the TCP software has no idea of what the bytes mean and no interest
in finding out. A byte is just a byte.
When an application passes data to TCP, TCP may send it immediately or
buffer it (in order to collect a larger amount to send at once), at its discretion.
However, sometimes the application really wants the data to be sent immediately.
For example, suppose a user of an interactive game wants to send a stream of
updates. It is essential that the updates be sent immediately, not buffered until
there is a collection of them. To force data out, TCP has the notion of a PUSH
flag that is carried on packets. The original intent was to let applications tell TCP
implementations via the PUSH flag not to delay the transmission. However, ap-
plications cannot literally set the PUSH flag when they send data. Instead, dif-
ferent operating systems have evolved different options to expedite transmission
(e.g., TCP NODELAY in Windows and Linux).
For Internet archaeologists, we will also mention one interesting feature of
TCP service that remains in the protocol but is rarely used: urgent data. When
an application has high priority data that should be processed immediately, for ex-
ample, if an interactive user hits the CTRL-C key to break off a remote computa-
tion that has already begun, the sending application can put some control infor-
mation in the data stream and give it to TCP along with the URGENT flag. This
event causes TCP to stop accumulating data and transmit everything it has for that
connection immediately.
When the urgent data are received at the destination, the receiving application
is interrupted (e.g., given a signal in UNIX terms) so it can stop whatever it was
doing and read the data stream to find the urgent data. The end of the urgent data
is marked so the application knows when it is over. The start of the urgent data is
not marked. It is up to the application to figure that out.
This scheme provides a crude signaling mechanism and leaves everything else
up to the application. However, while urgent data is potentially useful, it found no
compelling application early on and fell into disuse. Its use is now discouraged
because of implementation differences, leaving applications to handle their own
signaling. Perhaps future transport protocols will provide better signaling.

6.5.3 The TCP Protocol
In this section, we will give a general overview of the TCP protocol. In the
next one, we will go over the protocol header, field by field.
A key feature of TCP, and one that dominates the protocol design, is that
every byte on a TCP connection has its own 32-bit sequence number. When the
Internet began, the lines between routers were mostly 56-kbps leased lines, so a
host blasting away at full speed took over 1 week to cycle through the sequence
numbers. At modern network speeds, the sequence numbers can be consumed at
an alarming rate, as we will see later. Separate 32-bit sequence numbers are car-
ried on packets for the sliding window position in one direction and for acknowl-
edgements in the reverse direction, as discussed below.
The sending and receiving TCP entities exchange data in the form of seg-
ments. A TCP segment consists of a fixed 20-byte header (plus an optional part)
followed by zero or more data bytes. The TCP software decides how big seg-
ments should be. It can accumulate data from several writes into one segment or
can split data from one write over multiple segments. Two limits restrict the seg-
ment size. First, each segment, including the TCP header, must fit in the 65,515-
byte IP payload. Second, each link has an MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit).
Each segment must fit in the MTU at the sender and receiver so that it can be sent
and received in a single, unfragmented packet. In practice, the MTU is generally
1500 bytes (the Ethernet payload size) and thus defines the upper bound on seg-
ment size.
However, it is still possible for IP packets carrying TCP segments to be frag-
mented when passing over a network path for which some link has a small MTU.
If this happens, it degrades performance and causes other problems (Kent and
Mogul, 1987).
Instead, modern TCP implementations perform path MTU
discovery by using the technique outlined in RFC 1191 that we described in Sec.
5.5.5. This technique uses ICMP error messages to find the smallest MTU for any
link on the path. TCP then adjusts the segment size downwards to avoid frag-
mentation.
The basic protocol used by TCP entities is the sliding window protocol with a
dynamic window size. When a sender transmits a segment, it also starts a timer.
When the segment arrives at the destination, the receiving TCP entity sends back
a segment (with data if any exist, and otherwise without) bearing an acknowledge-
ment number equal to the next sequence number it expects to receive and the re-
maining window size. If the sender’s timer goes off before the acknowledgement
is received, the sender transmits the segment again.
Although this protocol sounds simple, there are many sometimes subtle ins
and outs, which we will cover below. Segments can arrive out of order, so bytes
3072–4095 can arrive but cannot be acknowledged because bytes 2048–3071 have
not turned up yet. Segments can also be delayed so long in transit that the sender
times out and retransmits them. The retransmissions may include different byte

557
ranges than the original transmission, requiring careful administration to keep
track of which bytes have been correctly received so far. However, since each
byte in the stream has its own unique offset, it can be done.
TCP must be prepared to deal with these problems and solve them in an effi-
cient way. A considerable amount of effort has gone into optimizing the per-
formance of TCP streams, even in the face of network problems. A number of the
algorithms used by many TCP implementations will be discussed below.
6.5.4 The TCP Segment Header
Figure 6-36 shows the layout of a TCP segment. Every segment begins with a
fixed-format, 20-byte header. The fixed header may be followed by header op-
tions. After the options, if any, up to 65,535 −20 −20 = 65,495 data bytes may
follow, where the first 20 refer to the IP header and the second to the TCP header.
Segments without any data are legal and are commonly used for acknowledge-
ments and control messages.

Figure 6-36. The TCP header.
Let us dissect the TCP header field by field. The Source port and Destination
port fields identify the local end points of the connection. A TCP port plus its
host’s IP address forms a 48-bit unique end point. The source and destination end
points together identify the connection. This connection identifier is called a 5
tuple because it consists of five pieces of information: the protocol (TCP), source
IP and source port, and destination IP and destination port.

The Sequence number and Acknowledgement number fields perform their
usual functions. Note that the latter specifies the next in-order byte expected, not
the last byte correctly received. It is a cumulative acknowledgement because it
summarizes the received data with a single number. It does not go beyond lost
data. Both are 32 bits because every byte of data is numbered in a TCP stream.
The TCP header length tells how many 32-bit words are contained in the TCP
header. This information is needed because the Options field is of variable length,
so the header is, too. Technically, this field really indicates the start of the data
within the segment, measured in 32-bit words, but that number is just the header
length in words, so the effect is the same.
Next comes a 4-bit field that is not used. The fact that these bits have
remained unused for 30 years (as only 2 of the original reserved 6 bits have been
reclaimed) is testimony to how well thought out TCP is. Lesser protocols would
have needed these bits to fix bugs in the original design.
Now come eight 1-bit flags. CWR and ECE are used to signal congestion
when ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) is used, as specified in RFC 3168.
ECE is set to signal an ECN-Echo to a TCP sender to tell it to slow down when
the TCP receiver gets a congestion indication from the network. CWR is set to
signal Congestion Window Reduced from the TCP sender to the TCP receiver so
that it knows the sender has slowed down and can stop sending the ECN-Echo.
We discuss the role of ECN in TCP congestion control in Sec. 6.5.10.
URG is set to 1 if the Urgent pointer is in use. The Urgent pointer is used to
indicate a byte offset from the current sequence number at which urgent data are
to be found. This facility is in lieu of interrupt messages. As we mentioned
above, this facility is a bare-bones way of allowing the sender to signal the re-
ceiver without getting TCP itself involved in the reason for the interrupt, but it is
seldom used.
The ACK bit is set to 1 to indicate that the Acknowledgement number is valid.
This is the case for nearly all packets. If ACK is 0, the segment does not contain
an acknowledgement, so the Acknowledgement number field is ignored.
The PSH bit indicates PUSHed data. The receiver is hereby kindly requested
to deliver the data to the application upon arrival and not buffer it until a full buff-
er has been received (which it might otherwise do for efficiency).
The RST bit is used to abruptly reset a connection that has become confused
due to a host crash or some other reason. It is also used to reject an invalid seg-
ment or refuse an attempt to open a connection. In general, if you get a segment
with the RST bit on, you have a problem on your hands.
The SYN bit is used to establish connections. The connection request has
SYN = 1 and ACK = 0 to indicate that the piggyback acknowledgement field is not
in use. The connection reply does bear an acknowledgement, however, so it has
SYN = 1 and ACK = 1. In essence, the SYN bit is used to denote both CONNEC-
TION REQUEST and CONNECTION ACCEPTED, with the ACK bit used to distin-
guish between those two possibilities.

The FIN bit is used to release a connection. It specifies that the sender has no
more data to transmit. However, after closing a connection, the closing process
may continue to receive data indefinitely. Both SYN and FIN segments have se-
quence numbers and are thus guaranteed to be processed in the correct order.
Flow control in TCP is handled using a variable-sized sliding window. The
Window size field tells how many bytes may be sent starting at the byte acknow-
ledged. A Window size field of 0 is legal and says that the bytes up to and includ-
ing Acknowledgement number −1 have been received, but that the receiver has
not had a chance to consume the data and would like no more data for the mo-
ment, thank you. The receiver can later grant permission to send by transmitting a
segment with the same Acknowledgement number and a nonzero Window size
field.
In the protocols of Chap. 3, acknowledgements of frames received and per-
mission to send new frames were tied together. This was a consequence of a
fixed window size for each protocol. In TCP, acknowledgements and permission
to send additional data are completely decoupled. In effect, a receiver can say: ‘‘I
have received bytes up through k but I do not want any more just now, thank
you.’’ This decoupling (in fact, a variable-sized window) gives additional flexibil-
ity. We will study it in detail below.
A Checksum is also provided for extra reliability. It checksums the header,
the data, and a conceptual pseudoheader in exactly the same way as UDP, except
that the pseudoheader has the protocol number for TCP (6) and the checksum is
mandatory. Please see Sec. 6.4.1 for details.
The Options field provides a way to add extra facilities not covered by the
regular header. Many options have been defined and several are commonly used.
The options are of variable length, fill a multiple of 32 bits by using padding with
zeros, and may extend to 40 bytes to accommodate the longest TCP header that
can be specified. Some options are carried when a connection is established to ne-
gotiate or inform the other side of capabilities. Other options are carried on pack-
ets during the lifetime of the connection. Each option has a Type-Length-Value
encoding.
A widely used option is the one that allows each host to specify the MSS
(Maximum Segment Size) it is willing to accept. Using large segments is more
efficient than using small ones because the 20-byte header can be amortized over
more data, but small hosts may not be able to handle big segments. During con-
nection setup, each side can announce its maximum and see its partner’s. If a host
does not use this option, it defaults to a 536-byte payload. All Internet hosts are
required to accept TCP segments of 536 + 20 = 556 bytes. The maximum seg-
ment size in the two directions need not be the same.
For lines with high bandwidth, high delay, or both, the 64-KB window corres-
ponding to a 16-bit field is a problem. For example, on an OC-12 line (of roughly
600 Mbps), it takes less than 1 msec to output a full 64-KB window. If the
round-trip propagation delay is 50 msec (which is typical for a transcontinental

THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
fiber), the sender will be idle more than 98% of the time waiting for acknowledge-
ments. A larger window size would allow the sender to keep pumping data out.
The window scale option allows the sender and receiver to negotiate a window
scale factor at the start of a connection. Both sides use the scale factor to shift the
Window size field up to 14 bits to the left, thus allowing windows of up to 230
bytes. Most TCP implementations support this option.
The timestamp option carries a timestamp sent by the sender and echoed by
the receiver. It is included in every packet, once its use is established during con-
nection setup, and used to compute round-trip time samples that are used to esti-
mate when a packet has been lost. It is also used as a logical extension of the 32-
bit sequence number. On a fast connection, the sequence number may wrap
around quickly, leading to possible confusion between old and new data. The
PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers) scheme discards ar-
riving segments with old timestamps to prevent this problem.
Finally, the SACK (Selective ACKnowledgement) option lets a receiver tell
a sender the ranges of sequence numbers that it has received. It supplements the
Acknowledgement number and is used after a packet has been lost but subsequent
(or duplicate) data has arrived. The new data is not reflected by the Acknowledge-
ment number field in the header because that field gives only the next in-order
byte that is expected. With SACK, the sender is explicitly aware of what data the
receiver has and hence can determine what data should be retransmitted. SACK
is defined in RFC 2108 and RFC 2883 and is increasingly used. We describe the
use of SACK along with congestion control in Sec. 6.5.10.
6.5.5 TCP Connection Establishment
Connections are established in TCP by means of the three-way handshake dis-
cussed in Sec. 6.2.2. To establish a connection, one side, say, the server, pas-
sively waits for an incoming connection by executing the LISTEN and ACCEPT
primitives in that order, either specifying a specific source or nobody in particular.
The other side, say, the client, executes a CONNECT primitive, specifying the
IP address and port to which it wants to connect, the maximum TCP segment size
it is willing to accept, and optionally some user data (e.g., a password). The CON-
NECT primitive sends a TCP segment with the SYN bit on and ACK bit off and
waits for a response.
When this segment arrives at the destination, the TCP entity there checks to
see if there is a process that has done a LISTEN on the port given in the Destination
port field. If not, it sends a reply with the RST bit on to reject the connection.
If some process is listening to the port, that process is given the incoming
TCP segment. It can either accept or reject the connection. If it accepts, an ac-
knowledgement segment is sent back. The sequence of TCP segments sent in the
normal case is shown in Fig. 6-37(a). Note that a SYN segment consumes 1 byte
of sequence space so that it can be acknowledged unambiguously.

In the event that two hosts simultaneously attempt to establish a connection
between the same two sockets, the sequence of events is as illustrated in Fig. 6-
37(b). The result of these events is that just one connection is established, not
two, because connections are identified by their end points. If the first setup re-
sults in a connection identified by (x, y) and the second one does too, only one
table entry is made, namely, for (x, y).
Recall that the initial sequence number chosen by each host should cycle
slowly, rather than be a constant such as 0. This rule is to protect against delayed
duplicate packets, as we discussed in Sec 6.2.2. Originally this was accomplished
with a clock-based scheme in which the clock ticked every 4 μsec.
However, a vulnerability with implementing the three-way handshake is that
the listening process must remember its sequence number as soon it responds with
its own SYN segment. This means that a malicious sender can tie up resources on
a host by sending a stream of SYN segments and never following through to com-
plete the connection. This attack is called a SYN flood, and it crippled many
Web servers in the 1990s.
One way to defend against this attack is to use SYN cookies. Instead of
remembering the sequence number, a host chooses a cryptographically generated
sequence number, puts it on the outgoing segment, and forgets it. If the three-way
handshake completes, this sequence number (plus 1) will be returned to the host.
It can then regenerate the correct sequence number by running the same crypto-
graphic function, as long as the inputs to that function are known, for example, the
other host’s IP address and port, and a local secret. This procedure allows the host
to check that an acknowledged sequence number is correct without having to

---

THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
remember the sequence number separately. There are some caveats, such as the
inability to handle TCP options, so SYN cookies may be used only when the host
is subject to a SYN flood. However, they are an interesting twist on connection
establishment. For more information, see RFC 4987 and Lemon (2002).
6.5.6 TCP Connection Release
Although TCP connections are full duplex, to understand how connections are
released it is best to think of them as a pair of simplex connections. Each simplex
connection is released independently of its sibling. To release a connection, either
party can send a TCP segment with the FIN bit set, which means that it has no
more data to transmit. When the FIN is acknowledged, that direction is shut down
for new data. Data may continue to flow indefinitely in the other direction, how-
ever. When both directions have been shut down, the connection is released.
Normally, four TCP segments are needed to release a connection: one FIN and
one ACK for each direction. However, it is possible for the first ACK and the sec-
ond FIN to be contained in the same segment, reducing the total count to three.
Just as with telephone calls in which both people say goodbye and hang up the
phone simultaneously, both ends of a TCP connection may send FIN segments at
the same time. These are each acknowledged in the usual way, and the con-
nection is shut down. There is, in fact, no essential difference between the two
hosts releasing sequentially or simultaneously.
To avoid the two-army problem (discussed in Sec. 6.2.3), timers are used. If a
response to a FIN is not forthcoming within two maximum packet lifetimes, the
sender of the FIN releases the connection. The other side will eventually notice
that nobody seems to be listening to it anymore and will time out as well. While
this solution is not perfect, given the fact that a perfect solution is theoretically
impossible, it will have to do. In practice, problems rarely arise.
6.5.7 TCP Connection Management Modeling
The steps required to establish and release connections can be represented in a
finite state machine with the 11 states listed in Fig. 6-38. In each state, certain
events are legal. When a legal event happens, some action may be taken. If some
other event happens, an error is reported.
Each connection starts in the CLOSED state. It leaves that state when it does
either a passive open (LISTEN) or an active open (CONNECT). If the other side
does the opposite one, a connection is established and the state becomes ESTA-
BLISHED. Connection release can be initiated by either side. When it is com-
plete, the state returns to CLOSED.
The finite state machine itself is shown in Fig. 6-39. The common case of a
client actively connecting to a passive server is shown with heavy lines—solid for
the client, dotted for the server. The lightface lines are unusual event sequences.

Figure 6-38. The states used in the TCP connection management finite state machine.
Each line in Fig. 6-39 is marked by an event/action pair. The event can either be
a user-initiated system call (CONNECT, LISTEN, SEND, or CLOSE), a segment arrival
(SYN, FIN, ACK, or RST), or, in one case, a timeout of twice the maximum packet
lifetime. The action is the sending of a control segment (SYN, FIN, or RST) or
nothing, indicated by —. Comments are shown in parentheses.
One can best understand the diagram by first following the path of a client
(the heavy solid line), then later following the path of a server (the heavy dashed
line). When an application program on the client machine issues a CONNECT re-
quest, the local TCP entity creates a connection record, marks it as being in the
SYN SENT state, and shoots off a SYN segment. Note that many connections may
be open (or being opened) at the same time on behalf of multiple applications, so
the state is per connection and recorded in the connection record. When the
SYN+ACK arrives, TCP sends the final ACK of the three-way handshake and
switches into the ESTABLISHED state. Data can now be sent and received.
When an application is finished, it executes a CLOSE primitive, which causes
the local TCP entity to send a FIN segment and wait for the corresponding ACK
(dashed box marked ‘‘active close’’). When the ACK arrives, a transition is made
to the state FIN WAIT 2 and one direction of the connection is closed. When the
other side closes, too, a FIN comes in, which is acknowledged. Now both sides
are closed, but TCP waits a time equal to twice the maximum packet lifetime to
guarantee that all packets from the connection have died off, just in case the ac-
knowledgement was lost. When the timer goes off, TCP deletes the connection
record.
Now let us examine connection management from the server’s viewpoint.
The server does a LISTEN and settles down to see who turns up. When a SYN

6.5.8 TCP Sliding Window
As mentioned earlier, window management in TCP decouples the issues of
acknowledgement of the correct receipt of segments and receiver buffer alloca-
tion. For example, suppose the receiver has a 4096-byte buffer, as shown in
Fig. 6-40. If the sender transmits a 2048-byte segment that is correctly received,
the receiver will acknowledge the segment. However, since it now has only 2048
bytes of buffer space (until the application removes some data from the buffer), it
will advertise a window of 2048 starting at the next byte expected.

process on the receiving host has removed some data from the buffer, at which
time TCP can advertise a larger window and more data can be sent.
When the window is 0, the sender may not normally send segments, with two
exceptions. First, urgent data may be sent, for example, to allow the user to kill
the process running on the remote machine. Second, the sender may send a 1-byte
segment to force the receiver to reannounce the next byte expected and the win-
dow size. This packet is called a window probe. The TCP standard explicitly
provides this option to prevent deadlock if a window update ever gets lost.
Senders are not required to transmit data as soon as they come in from the ap-
plication. Neither are receivers required to send acknowledgements as soon as
possible. For example, in Fig. 6-40, when the first 2 KB of data came in, TCP,
knowing that it had a 4-KB window, would have been completely correct in just
buffering the data until another 2 KB came in, to be able to transmit a segment
with a 4-KB payload. This freedom can be used to improve performance.
Consider a connection to a remote terminal, for example using SSH or telnet,
that reacts on every keystroke. In the worst case, whenever a character arrives at
the sending TCP entity, TCP creates a 21-byte TCP segment, which it gives to IP
to send as a 41-byte IP datagram. At the receiving side, TCP immediately sends a
40-byte acknowledgement (20 bytes of TCP header and 20 bytes of IP header).
Later, when the remote terminal has read the byte, TCP sends a window update,
moving the window 1 byte to the right. This packet is also 40 bytes. Finally, when
the remote terminal has processed the character, it echoes the character for local
display using a 41-byte packet. In all, 162 bytes of bandwidth are used and four
segments are sent for each character typed. When bandwidth is scarce, this meth-
od of doing business is not desirable.
One approach that many TCP implementations use to optimize this situation
is called delayed acknowledgements. The idea is to delay acknowledgements
and window updates for up to 500 msec in the hope of acquiring some data on
which to hitch a free ride. Assuming the terminal echoes within 500 msec, only
one 41-byte packet now need be sent back by the remote side, cutting the packet
count and bandwidth usage in half.
Although delayed acknowledgements reduce the load placed on the network
by the receiver, a sender that sends multiple short packets (e.g., 41-byte packets
containing 1 byte of data) is still operating inefficiently. A way to reduce this
usage is known as Nagle’s algorithm (Nagle, 1984). What Nagle suggested is
simple: when data come into the sender in small pieces, just send the first piece
and buffer all the rest until the first piece is acknowledged. Then send all the
buffered data in one TCP segment and start buffering again until the next segment
is acknowledged. That is, only one short packet can be outstanding at any time.
If many pieces of data are sent by the application in one round-trip time, Nagle’s
algorithm will put the many pieces in one segment, greatly reducing the band-
width used. The algorithm additionally says that a new segment should be sent if
enough data have trickled in to fill a maximum segment.

---

## Page 73

SEC. 6.5
THE INTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP
567
Nagle’s algorithm is widely used by TCP implementations, but there are times
when it is better to disable it. In particular, in interactive games that are run over
the Internet, the players typically want a rapid stream of short update packets.
Gathering the updates to send them in bursts makes the game respond erratically,
which makes for unhappy users. A more subtle problem is that Nagle’s algorithm
can sometimes interact with delayed acknowledgements to cause a temporary
deadlock: the receiver waits for data on which to piggyback an acknowledgement,
and the sender waits on the acknowledgement to send more data. This interaction
can delay the downloads of Web pages. Because of these problems, Nagle’s algo-
rithm can be disabled (which is called the TCP NODELAY option). Mogul and
Minshall (2001) discuss this and other solutions.
Another problem that can degrade TCP performance is the silly window syn-
drome (Clark, 1982). This problem occurs when data are passed to the sending
TCP entity in large blocks, but an interactive application on the receiving side
reads data only 1 byte at a time. To see the problem, look at Fig. 6-41. Initially,
the TCP buffer on the receiving side is full (i.e., it has a window of size 0) and the
sender knows this. Then the interactive application reads one character from the
TCP stream. This action makes the receiving TCP happy, so it sends a window
update to the sender saying that it is all right to send 1 byte. The sender obliges
and sends 1 byte. The buffer is now full, so the receiver acknowledges the 1-byte
segment and sets the window to 0. This behavior can go on forever.
Clark’s solution is to prevent the receiver from sending a window update for 1
byte. Instead, it is forced to wait until it has a decent amount of space available
and advertise that instead. Specifically, the receiver should not send a window
update until it can handle the maximum segment size it advertised when the con-
nection was established or until its buffer is half empty, whichever is smaller.
Furthermore, the sender can also help by not sending tiny segments. Instead, it
should wait until it can send a full segment, or at least one containing half of the
receiver’s buffer size.
Nagle’s algorithm and Clark’s solution to the silly window syndrome are
complementary. Nagle was trying to solve the problem caused by the sending ap-
plication delivering data to TCP a byte at a time. Clark was trying to solve the
problem of the receiving application sucking the data up from TCP a byte at a
time. Both solutions are valid and can work together. The goal is for the sender
not to send small segments and the receiver not to ask for them.
The receiving TCP can go further in improving performance than just doing
window updates in large units. Like the sending TCP, it can also buffer data, so it
can block a READ request from the application until it has a large chunk of data
for it. Doing so reduces the number of calls to TCP (and the overhead). It also
increases the response time, but for noninteractive applications like file transfer,
efficiency may be more important than response time to individual requests.
Another issue that the receiver must handle is that segments may arrive out of
order. The receiver will buffer the data until it can be passed up to the application

in order. Actually, nothing bad would happen if out-of-order segments were dis-
carded, since they would eventually be retransmitted by the sender, but it would
be wasteful.
Acknowledgements can be sent only when all the data up to the byte acknow-
ledged have been received. This is called a cumulative acknowledgement. If
the receiver gets segments 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, it can acknowledge everything up
to and including the last byte in segment 2. When the sender times out, it then
retransmits segment 3. As the receiver has buffered segments 4 through 7, upon
receipt of segment 3 it can acknowledge all bytes up to the end of segment 7.
6.5.9 TCP Timer Management
TCP uses multiple timers (at least conceptually) to do its work. The most im-
portant of these is the RTO (Retransmission TimeOut). When a segment is
sent, a retransmission timer is started. If the segment is acknowledged before the
timer expires, the timer is stopped. If, on the other hand, the timer goes off before
the acknowledgement comes in, the segment is retransmitted (and the timer os
started again). The question that arises is: how long should the timeout be?
This problem is much more difficult in the transport layer than in data link
protocols such as 802.11. In the latter case, the expected delay is measured in

microseconds and is highly predictable (i.e., has a low variance), so the timer can
be set to go off just slightly after the acknowledgement is expected, as shown in
Fig. 6-42(a). Since acknowledgements are rarely delayed in the data link layer
(due to lack of congestion), the absence of an acknowledgement at the expected
time generally means either the frame or the acknowledgement has been lost.

TCP is faced with a radically different environment. The probability density
function for the time it takes for a TCP acknowledgement to come back looks
more like Fig. 6-42(b) than Fig. 6-42(a). It is larger and more variable. Deter-
mining the round-trip time to the destination is tricky. Even when it is known,
deciding on the timeout interval is also difficult. If the timeout is set too short,
say, T 1 in Fig. 6-42(b), unnecessary retransmissions will occur, clogging the In-
ternet with useless packets. If it is set too long (e.g., T 2), performance will suffer
due to the long retransmission delay whenever a packet is lost. Furthermore, the
mean and variance of the acknowledgement arrival distribution can change rapid-
ly within a few seconds as congestion builds up or is resolved.
The solution is to use a dynamic algorithm that constantly adapts the timeout
interval, based on continuous measurements of network performance. The algo-
rithm generally used by TCP is due to Jacobson (1988) and works as follows. For
each connection, TCP maintains a variable, SRTT (Smoothed Round-Trip Time),
that is the best current estimate of the round-trip time to the destination in ques-
tion. When a segment is sent, a timer is started, both to see how long the ac-
knowledgement takes and also to trigger a retransmission if it takes too long. If

the acknowledgement gets back before the timer expires, TCP measures how long
the acknowledgement took, say, R. It then updates SRTT according to the formula
SRTT = α SRTT + (1 −α) R
where α is a smoothing factor that determines how quickly the old values are for-
gotten. Typically, α = 7/8. This kind of formula is an EWMA (Exponentially
Weighted Moving Average) or low-pass filter that discards noise in the samples.
Even given a good value of SRTT, choosing a suitable retransmission timeout
is a nontrivial matter. Initial implementations of TCP used 2xRTT, but experience
showed that a constant value was too inflexible because it failed to respond when
the variance went up. In particular, queueing models of random (i.e., Poisson)
traffic predict that when the load approaches capacity, the delay becomes large
and highly variable. This can lead to the retransmission timer firing and a copy of
the packet being retransmitted although the original packet is still transiting the
network. It is all the more likely to happen under conditions of high load, which is
the worst time at which to send additional packets into the network.
To fix this problem, Jacobson proposed making the timeout value sensitive to
the variance in round-trip times as well as the smoothed round-trip time. This
change requires keeping track of another smoothed variable, RTTVAR (Round-
Trip Time VARiation) that is updated using the formula
RTTVAR = β RTTVAR + (1 −β) | SRTT −R |
This is an EWMA as before, and typically β = 3/4. The retransmission timeout,
RTO, is set to be
RTO = SRTT + 4 × RTTVAR
The choice of the factor 4 is somewhat arbitrary, but multiplication by 4 can be
done with a single shift, and less than 1% of all packets come in more than four
standard deviations late. Note that RTTVAR is not exactly the same as the standard
deviation (it is really the mean deviation), but it is close enough in practice.
Jacobson’s paper is full of clever tricks to compute timeouts using only integer
adds, subtracts, and shifts. This economy is not needed for modern hosts, but it
has become part of the culture that allows TCP to run on all manner of devices,
from supercomputers down to tiny devices. So far nobody has put it on an RFID
chip, but someday? Who knows.
More details of how to compute this timeout, including initial settings of the
variables, are given in RFC 2988. The retransmission timer is also held to a mini-
mum of 1 second, regardless of the estimates. This is a conservative value chosen
to prevent spurious retransmissions based on measurements (Allman and Paxson,
1999).
One problem that occurs with gathering the samples, R, of the round-trip time
is what to do when a segment times out and is sent again. When the acknowl-
edgement comes in, it is unclear whether the acknowledgement refers to the first

transmission or a later one. Guessing wrong can seriously contaminate the re-
transmission timeout. Phil Karn discovered this problem the hard way. Karn is
an amateur radio enthusiast interested in transmitting TCP/IP packets by ham
radio, a notoriously unreliable medium. He made a simple proposal: do not up-
date estimates on any segments that have been retransmitted. Additionally, the
timeout is doubled on each successive retransmission until the segments get
through the first time. This fix is called Karn’s algorithm (Karn and Partridge,
1987). Most TCP implementations use it.
The retransmission timer is not the only timer TCP uses. A second timer is
the persistence timer. It is designed to prevent the following deadlock. The re-
ceiver sends an acknowledgement with a window size of 0, telling the sender to
wait. Later, the receiver updates the window, but the packet with the update is
lost. Now the sender and the receiver are each waiting for the other to do some-
thing. When the persistence timer goes off, the sender transmits a probe to the re-
ceiver. The response to the probe gives the window size. If it is still 0, the per-
sistence timer is set again and the cycle repeats. If it is nonzero, data can now be
sent.
A third timer that some implementations use is the keepalive timer. When a
connection has been idle for a long time, the keepalive timer may go off to cause
one side to check whether the other side is still there. If it fails to respond, the con-
nection is terminated. This feature is controversial because it adds overhead and
may terminate an otherwise healthy connection due to a transient network parti-
tion.
The last timer used on each TCP connection is the one used in the TIME
WAIT state while closing. It runs for twice the maximum packet lifetime to make
sure that when a connection is closed, all packets created by it have died off.
6.5.10 TCP Congestion Control
We have saved one of the key functions of TCP for last: congestion control.
When the load offered to any network is more than it can handle, congestion
builds up. The Internet is no exception. The network layer detects congestion
when queues grow large at routers and tries to manage it, if only by dropping
packets. It is up to the transport layer to receive congestion feedback from the
network layer and slow down the rate of traffic that it is sending into the network.
In the Internet, TCP plays the main role in controlling congestion, as well as the
main role in reliable transport. That is why it is such a special protocol.
We covered the general situation of congestion control in Sec. 6.3. One key
takeaway was that a transport protocol using an AIMD (Additive Increase Multi-
plicative Decrease) control law in response to binary congestion signals from the
network would converge to a fair and efficient bandwidth allocation. TCP con-
gestion control is based on implementing this approach using a window and with
packet loss as the binary signal. To do so, TCP maintains a congestion window

---

whose size is the number of bytes the sender may have in the network at any time.
The corresponding rate is the window size divided by the round-trip time of the
connection. TCP adjusts the size of the window according to the AIMD rule.
Recall that the congestion window is maintained in addition to the flow con-
trol window, which specifies the number of bytes that the receiver can buffer.
Both windows are tracked in parallel, and the number of bytes that may be sent is
the smaller of the two windows. Thus, the effective window is the smaller of
what the sender thinks is all right and what the receiver thinks is all right. It takes
two to tango. TCP will stop sending data if either the congestion or the flow con-
trol window is temporarily full. If the receiver says ‘‘send 64 KB’’ but the sender
knows that bursts of more than 32 KB clog the network, it will send 32 KB. On
the other hand, if the receiver says ‘‘send 64 KB’’ and the sender knows that
bursts of up to 128 KB get through effortlessly, it will send the full 64 KB re-
quested. The flow control window was described earlier, and in what follows we
will only describe the congestion window.
Modern congestion control was added to TCP largely through the efforts of
Van Jacobson (1988). It is a fascinating story. Starting in 1986, the growing pop-
ularity of the early Internet led to the first occurrence of what became known as a
congestion collapse, a prolonged period during which goodput dropped precipi-
tously (i.e., by more than a factor of 100) due to congestion in the network. Jacob-
son (and many others) set out to understand what was happening and remedy the
situation.
The high-level fix that Jacobson implemented was to approximate an AIMD
congestion window. The interesting part, and much of the complexity of TCP con-
gestion control, is how he added this to an existing implementation without chang-
ing any of the message formats, which made it instantly deployable. To start, he
observed that packet loss is a suitable signal of congestion. This signal comes a
little late (as the network is already congested) but it is quite dependable. After
all, it is difficult to build a router that does not drop packets when it is overloaded.
This fact is unlikely to change. Even when terabyte memories appear to buffer
vast numbers of packets, we will probably have terabit/sec networks to fill up
those memories.
However, using packet loss as a congestion signal depends on transmission er-
rors being relatively rare. This is not normally the case for wireless links such as
802.11, which is why they include their own retransmission mechanism at the link
layer. Because of wireless retransmissions, network layer packet loss due to
transmission errors is normally masked on wireless networks. It is also rare on
other links because wires and optical fibers typically have low bit-error rates.
All the Internet TCP algorithms assume that lost packets are caused by con-
gestion and monitor timeouts and look for signs of trouble the way miners watch
their canaries. A good retransmission timer is needed to detect packet loss signals
accurately and in a timely manner. We have already discussed how the TCP re-
transmission timer includes estimates of the mean and variation in round-trip

times. Fixing this timer, by including the variation factor, was an important step in
Jacobson’s work. Given a good retransmission timeout, the TCP sender can track
the outstanding number of bytes, which are loading the network. It simply looks
at the difference between the sequence numbers that are transmitted and acknow-
ledged.
Now it seems that our task is easy. All we need to do is to track the conges-
tion window, using sequence and acknowledgement numbers, and adjust the con-
gestion window using an AIMD rule. As you might have expected, it is more
complicated than that. A first consideration is that the way packets are sent into
the network, even over short periods of time, must be matched to the network
path. Otherwise the traffic will cause congestion. For example, consider a host
with a congestion window of 64 KB attached to a 1-Gbps switched Ethernet. If
the host sends the entire window at once, this burst of traffic may travel over a
slow 1-Mbps ADSL line further along the path. The burst that took only half a
millisecond on the 1-Gbps line will clog the 1-Mbps line for half a second, com-
pletely disrupting protocols such as voice over IP. This behavior might be a good
idea for a protocol designed to cause congestion, but not for a protocol to control
it.
However, it turns out that we can use small bursts of packets to our advan-
tage. Fig. 6-43 shows what happens when a sender on a fast network (the 1-Gbps
link) sends a small burst of four packets to a receiver on a slow network (the 1-
Mbps link) that is the bottleneck or slowest part of the path. Initially the four
packets travel over the link as quickly as they can be sent by the sender. At the
router, they are queued while being sent because it takes longer to send a packet
over the slow link than to receive the next packet over the fast link. But the queue
is not large because only a small number of packets were sent at once. Note the
increased length of the packets on the slow link. The same packet, of 1 KB say, is
now longer because it takes more time to send it on a slow link than on a fast one.

Eventually the packets get to the receiver, where they are acknowledged. The
times for the acknowledgements reflect the times at which the packets arrived at
the receiver after crossing the slow link. They are spread out compared to the
original packets on the fast link. As these acknowledgements travel over the net-
work and back to the sender they preserve this timing.

CHAP. 6
The key observation is this: the acknowledgements return to the sender at
about the rate that packets can be sent over the slowest link in the path. This is
precisely the rate that the sender wants to use. If it injects new packets into the
network at this rate, they will be sent as fast as the slow link permits, but they will
not queue up and congest any router along the path. This timing is known as an
ack clock. It is an essential part of TCP. By using an ack clock, TCP smoothes
out traffic and avoids unnecessary queues at routers.
A second consideration is that the AIMD rule will take a very long time to
reach a good operating point on fast networks if the congestion window is started
from a small size. Consider a modest network path that can support 10 Mbps with
an RTT of 100 msec. The appropriate congestion window is the bandwidth-delay
product, which is 1 Mbit or 100 packets of 1250 bytes each. If the congestion win-
dow starts at 1 packet and increases by 1 packet every RTT, it will be 100 RTTs
or 10 seconds before the connection is running at about the right rate. That is a
long time to wait just to get to the right speed for a transfer. We could reduce this
startup time by starting with a larger initial window, say of 50 packets. But this
window would be far too large for slow or short links. It would cause congestion
if used all at once, as we have just described.
Instead, the solution Jacobson chose to handle both of these considerations is
a mix of linear and multiplicative increase. When a connection is established, the
sender initializes the congestion window to a small initial value of at most four
segments; the details are described in RFC 3390, and the use of four segments is
an increase from an earlier initial value of one segment based on experience. The
sender then sends the initial window. The packets will take a round-trip time to
be acknowledged. For each segment that is acknowledged before the retransmis-
sion timer goes off, the sender adds one segment’s worth of bytes to the conges-
tion window. Plus, as that segment has been acknowledged, there is now one less
segment in the network. The upshot is that every acknowledged segment allows
two more segments to be sent. The congestion window is doubling every round-
trip time.
This algorithm is called slow start, but it is not slow at all—it is exponential
growth—except in comparison to the previous algorithm that let an entire flow
control window be sent all at once. Slow start is shown in Fig. 6-44. In the first
round-trip time, the sender injects one packet into the network (and the receiver
receives one packet). Two packets are sent in the next round-trip time, then four
packets in the third round-trip time.
Slow-start works well over a range of link speeds and round-trip times, and
uses an ack clock to match the rate of sender transmissions to the network path.
Take a look at the way acknowledgements return from the sender to the receiver
in Fig. 6-44. When the sender gets an acknowledgement, it increases the conges-
tion window by one and immediately sends two packets into the network. (One
packet is the increase by one; the other packet is a replacement for the packet that
has been acknowledged and left the network.
At all times, the number of

unacknowledged packets is given by the congestion window.) However, these two
packets will not necessarily arrive at the receiver as closely spaced as when they
were sent. For example, suppose the sender is on a 100-Mbps Ethernet. Each
packet of 1250 bytes takes 100 μsec to send. So the delay between the packets can
be as small as 100 μsec. The situation changes if these packets go across a 1-
Mbps ADSL link anywhere along the path. It now takes 10 msec to send the same
packet.
This means that the minimum spacing between the two packets has
grown by a factor of 100. Unless the packets have to wait together in a queue on a
later link, the spacing will remain large.
In Fig. 6-44, this effect is shown by enforcing a minimum spacing between
data packets arriving at the receiver. The same spacing is kept when the receiver
sends acknowledgements, and thus when the sender receives the acknowledge-
ments. If the network path is slow, acknowledgements will come in slowly (after
a delay of an RTT). If the network path is fast, acknowledgements will come in
quickly (again, after the RTT). All the sender has to do is follow the timing of the
ack clock as it injects new packets, which is what slow start does.
Because slow start causes exponential growth, eventually (and sooner rather
than later) it will send too many packets into the network too quickly. When this
happens, queues will build up in the network. When the queues are full, one or
more packets will be lost. After this happens, the TCP sender will time out when
an acknowledgement fails to arrive in time. There is evidence of slow start grow-
ing too fast in Fig. 6-44. After three RTTs, four packets are in the network. These
four packets take an entire RTT to arrive at the receiver. That is, a congestion
window of four packets is the right size for this connection. However, as these
packets are acknowledged, slow start continues to grow the congestion window,
reaching eight packets in another RTT. Only four of these packets can reach the
receiver in one RTT, no matter how many are sent. That is, the network pipe is
full. Additional packets placed into the network by the sender will build up in

router queues, since they cannot be delivered to the receiver quickly enough. Con-
gestion and packet loss will occur soon.
To keep slow start under control, the sender keeps a threshold for the connect-
ion called the slow start threshold. Initially this value is set arbitrarily high, to
the size of the flow control window, so that it will not limit the connection. TCP
keeps increasing the congestion window in slow start until a timeout occurs or the
congestion window exceeds the threshold (or the receiver’s window is filled).
Whenever a packet loss is detected, for example, by a timeout, the slow start
threshold is set to be half of the congestion window and the entire process is
restarted. The idea is that the current window is too large because it caused con-
gestion previously that is only now detected by a timeout. Half of the window,
which was used successfully at an earlier time, is probably a better estimate for a
congestion window that is close to the path capacity but will not cause loss. In
our example in Fig. 6-44, growing the congestion window to eight packets may
cause loss, while the congestion window of four packets in the previous RTT was
the right value. The congestion window is then reset to its small initial value and
slow start resumes.
Whenever the slow start threshold is crossed, TCP switches from slow start to
additive increase. In this mode, the congestion window is increased by one seg-
ment every round-trip time. Like slow start, this is usually implemented with an
increase for every segment that is acknowledged, rather than an increase once per
RTT. Call the congestion window cwnd and the maximum segment size MSS. A
common approximation is to increase cwnd by (MSS × MSS)/cwnd for each of the
cwnd /MSS packets that may be acknowledged. This increase does not need to be
fast. The whole idea is for a TCP connection to spend a lot of time with its con-
gestion window close to the optimum value—not so small that throughput will be
low, and not so large that congestion will occur.
Additive increase is shown in Fig. 6-45 for the same situation as slow start. At
the end of every RTT, the sender’s congestion window has grown enough that it
can inject an additional packet into the network. Compared to slow start, the
linear rate of growth is much slower. It makes little difference for small conges-
tion windows, as is the case here, but a large difference in the time taken to grow
the congestion window to 100 segments, for example.
There is something else that we can do to improve performance too. The
defect in the scheme so far is waiting for a timeout. Timeouts are relatively long
because they must be conservative. After a packet is lost, the receiver cannot
acknowledge past it, so the acknowledgement number will stay fixed, and the
sender will not be able to send any new packets into the network because its con-
gestion window remains full. This condition can continue for a relatively long
period until the timer fires and the lost packet is retransmitted. At that stage, TCP
slow starts again.
There is a quick way for the sender to recognize that one of its packets has
been lost. As packets beyond the lost packet arrive at the receiver, they trigger

acknowledgements that return to the sender. These acknowledgements bear the
same acknowledgement number. They are called duplicate acknowledgements.
Each time the sender receives a duplicate acknowledgement, it is likely that an-
other packet has arrived at the receiver and the lost packet still has not shown up.
Because packets can take different paths through the network, they can arrive
out of order. This will trigger duplicate acknowledgements even though no pack-
ets have been lost. However, this is uncommon in the Internet much of the time.
When there is reordering across multiple paths, the received packets are usually
not reordered too much. Thus, TCP somewhat arbitrarily assumes that three dupli-
cate acknowledgements imply that a packet has been lost. The identity of the lost
packet can be inferred from the acknowledgement number as well. It is the very
next packet in sequence. This packet can then be retransmitted right away, before
the retransmission timeout fires.
This heuristic is called fast retransmission. After it fires, the slow start
threshold is still set to half the current congestion window, just as with a timeout.
Slow start can be restarted by setting the congestion window to one packet. With
this window size, a new packet will be sent after the one round-trip time that it
takes to acknowledge the retransmitted packet along with all data that had been
sent before the loss was detected.
An illustration of the congestion algorithm we have built up so far is shown in
Fig. 6-46. This version of TCP is called TCP Tahoe after the 4.2BSD Tahoe re-
lease in 1988 in which it was included. The maximum segment size here is 1 KB.
Initially, the congestion window was 64 KB, but a timeout occurred, so the thres-
hold is set to 32 KB and the congestion window to 1 KB for transmission 0. The
congestion window grows exponentially until it hits the threshold (32 KB). The

window is increased every time a new acknowledgement arrives rather than con-
tinuously, which leads to the discrete staircase pattern. After the threshold is pas-
sed, the window grows linearly. It is increased by one segment every RTT.

The transmissions in round 13 are unlucky (they should have known), and one
of them is lost in the network. This is detected when three duplicate acknowledge-
ments arrive. At that time, the lost packet is retransmitted, the threshold is set to
half the current window (by now 40 KB, so half is 20 KB), and slow start is ini-
tiated all over again. Restarting with a congestion window of one packet takes one
round-trip time for all of the previously transmitted data to leave the network and
be acknowledged, including the retransmitted packet. The congestion window
grows with slow start as it did previously, until it reaches the new threshold of 20
KB. At that time, the growth becomes linear again. It will continue in this fashion
until another packet loss is detected via duplicate acknowledgements or a timeout
(or the receiver’s window becomes the limit).
TCP Tahoe (which included good retransmission timers) provided a working
congestion control algorithm that solved the problem of congestion collapse.
Jacobson realized that it is possible to do even better. At the time of the fast re-
transmission, the connection is running with a congestion window that is too
large, but it is still running with a working ack clock. Every time another dupli-
cate acknowledgement arrives, it is likely that another packet has left the network.
Using duplicate acknowledgements to count the packets in the network, makes it
possible to let some packets exit the network and continue to send a new packet
for each additional duplicate acknowledgement.
Fast recovery is the heuristic that implements this behavior. It is a temporary
mode that aims to maintain the ack clock running with a congestion window that
is the new threshold, or half the value of the congestion window at the time of the

fast retransmission. To do this, duplicate acknowledgements are counted (includ-
ing the three that triggered fast retransmission) until the number of packets in the
network has fallen to the new threshold. This takes about half a round-trip time.
From then on, a new packet can be sent for each duplicate acknowledgement that
is received. One round-trip time after the fast retransmission, the lost packet will
have been acknowledged. At that time, the stream of duplicate acknowledgements
will cease and fast recovery mode will be exited. The congestion window will be
set to the new slow start threshold and grows by linear increase.
The upshot of this heuristic is that TCP avoids slow start, except when the
connection is first started and when a timeout occurs. The latter can still happen
when more than one packet is lost and fast retransmission does not recover ade-
quately. Instead of repeated slow starts, the congestion window of a running con-
nection follows a sawtooth pattern of additive increase (by one segment every
RTT) and multiplicative decrease (by half in one RTT). This is exactly the AIMD
rule that we sought to implement.
This sawtooth behavior is shown in Fig. 6-47. It is produced by TCP Reno,
named after the 4.3BSD Reno release in 1990 in which it was included. TCP
Reno is essentially TCP Tahoe plus fast recovery. After an initial slow start, the
congestion window climbs linearly until a packet loss is detected by duplicate ac-
knowledgements. The lost packet is retransmitted and fast recovery is used to
keep the ack clock running until the retransmission is acknowledged. At that time,
the congestion window is resumed from the new slow start threshold, rather than
from 1. This behavior continues indefinitely, and the connection spends most of
the time with its congestion window close to the optimum value of the band-
width-delay product.

the changes in the intervening years have adjusted these mechanisms in minor
ways, for example, by changing the choices of the initial window and removing
various ambiguities. Some improvements have been made for recovering from
two or more losses in a window of packets. For example, the TCP NewReno ver-
sion uses a partial advance of the acknowledgement number after a retransmission
to find and repair another loss (Hoe, 1996), as described in RFC 3782. Since the
mid-1990s, several variations have emerged that follow the principles we have de-
scribed but use slightly different control laws. For example, Linux uses a variant
called CUBIC TCP (Ha et al., 2008) and Windows includes a variant called Com-
pound TCP (Tan et al., 2006).
Two larger changes have also affected TCP implementations. First, much of
the complexity of TCP comes from inferring from a stream of duplicate acknowl-
edgements which packets have arrived and which packets have been lost. The
cumulative acknowledgement number does not provide this information. A sim-
ple fix is the use of SACK (Selective ACKnowledgements), which lists up to
three ranges of bytes that have been received. With this information, the sender
can more directly decide what packets to retransmit and track the packets in flight
to implement the congestion window.
When the sender and receiver set up a connection, they each send the SACK
permitted TCP option to signal that they understand selective acknowledgements.
Once SACK is enabled for a connection, it works as shown in Fig. 6-48. A re-
ceiver uses the TCP Acknowledgement number field in the normal manner, as a
cumulative acknowledgement of the highest in-order byte that has been received.
When it receives packet 3 out of order (because packet 2 was lost), it sends a
SACK option for the received data along with the (duplicate) cumulative acknowl-
edgement for packet 1. The SACK option gives the byte ranges that have been re-
ceived above the number given by the cumulative acknowledgement. The first
range is the packet that triggered the duplicate acknowledgement. The next
ranges, if present, are older blocks. Up to three ranges are commonly used. By
the time packet 6 is received, two SACK byte ranges are used to indicate that
packet 6 and packets 3 to 4 have been received, in addition to all packets up to
packet 1. From the information in each SACK option that it receives, the sender
can decide which packets to retransmit. In this case, retransmitting packets 2 and
5 would be a good idea.
SACK is strictly advisory information. The actual detection of loss using dup-
licate acknowledgements and adjustments to the congestion window proceed just
as before. However, with SACK, TCP can recover more easily from situations in
which multiple packets are lost at roughly the same time, since the TCP sender
knows which packets have not been received. SACK is now widely deployed. It
is described in RFC 2883, and TCP congestion control using SACK is described
in RFC 3517.
The second change is the use of ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) in
addition to packet loss as a congestion signal. ECN is an IP layer mechanism to

notify hosts of congestion that we described in Sec. 5.3.4. With it, the TCP re-
ceiver can receive congestion signals from IP.
The use of ECN is enabled for a TCP connection when both the sender and re-
ceiver indicate that they are capable of using ECN by setting the ECE and CWR
bits during connection establishment. If ECN is used, each packet that carries a
TCP segment is flagged in the IP header to show that it can carry an ECN signal.
Routers that support ECN will set a congestion signal on packets that can carry
ECN flags when congestion is approaching, instead of dropping those packets
after congestion has occurred.
The TCP receiver is informed if any packet that arrives carries an ECN con-
gestion signal. The receiver then uses the ECE (ECN Echo) flag to signal the TCP
sender that its packets have experienced congestion. The sender tells the receiver
that it has heard the signal by using the CWR (Congestion Window Reduced) flag.
The TCP sender reacts to these congestion notifications in exactly the same
way as it does to packet loss that is detected via duplicate acknowledgements.
However, the situation is strictly better. Congestion has been detected and no
packet was harmed in any way. ECN is described in RFC 3168. It requires both
host and router support, and is not yet widely used on the Internet.
For more information on the complete set of congestion control behaviors that
are implemented in TCP, see RFC 5681.
6.5.11 The Future of TCP
As the workhorse of the Internet, TCP has been used for many applications
and extended over time to give good performance over a wide range of networks.
Many versions are deployed with slightly different implementations than the clas-
sic algorithms we have described, especially for congestion control and robustness
against attacks. It is likely that TCP will continue to evolve with the Internet. We
will mention two particular issues.
The first one is that TCP does not provide the transport semantics that all ap-
plications want. For example, some applications want to send messages or records
whose boundaries need to be preserved. Other applications work with a group of

---

## Page 88

582
THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
related conversations, such as a Web browser that transfers several objects from
the same server. Still other applications want better control over the network paths
that they use. TCP with its standard sockets interface does not meet these needs
well. Essentially, the application has the burden of dealing with any problem not
solved by TCP. This has led to proposals for new protocols that would provide a
slightly different interface. Two examples are SCTP (Stream Control Transmis-
sion Protocol), defined in RFC 4960, and SST (Structured Stream Transport)
(Ford, 2007). However, whenever someone proposes changing something that
has worked so well for so long, there is always a huge battle between the ‘‘Users
are demanding more features’’ and ‘‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’’ camps.
The second issue is congestion control. You may have expected that this is a
solved problem after our deliberations and the mechanisms that have been devel-
oped over time. Not so. The form of TCP congestion control that we described,
and which is widely used, is based on packet losses as a signal of congestion.
When Padhye et al. (1998) modeled TCP throughput based on the sawtooth pat-
tern, they found that the packet loss rate must drop off rapidly with increasing
speed. To reach a throughput of 1 Gbps with a round-trip time of 100 ms and 1500
byte packets, one packet can be lost approximately every 10 minutes. That is a
packet loss rate of 2 × 10−8, which is incredibly small. It is too infrequent to serve
as a good congestion signal, and any other source of loss (e.g., packet transmis-
sion error rates of 10−7) can easily dominate it, limiting the throughput.
This relationship has not been a problem in the past, but networks are getting
faster and faster, leading many people to revisit congestion control. One possibil-
ity is to use an alternate congestion control in which the signal is not packet loss
at all. We gave several examples in Sec. 6.2. The signal might be round-trip time,
which grows when the network becomes congested, as is used by FAST TCP
(Wei et al., 2006). Other approaches are possible too, and time will tell which is
the best.
6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES
Performance issues are very important in computer networks. When hundreds
or thousands of computers are interconnected, complex interactions, with unfore-
seen consequences, are common. Frequently, this complexity leads to poor per-
formance and no one knows why. In the following sections, we will examine
many issues related to network performance to see what kinds of problems exist
and what can be done about them.
Unfortunately, understanding network performance is more an art than a sci-
ence. There is little underlying theory that is actually of any use in practice. The
best we can do is give some rules of thumb gained from hard experience and pres-
ent examples taken from the real world. We have delayed this discussion until we
studied the transport layer because the performance that applications receive

---

## Page 89

SEC. 6.6
PERFORMANCE ISSUES
583
depends on the combined performance of the transport, network and link layers,
and to be able to use TCP as an example in various places.
In the next sections, we will look at six aspects of network performance:
1. Performance problems.
2. Measuring network performance.
3. Host design for fast networks.
4. Fast segment processing.
5. Header compression.
6. Protocols for ‘‘long fat’’ networks.
These aspects consider network performance both at the host and across the net-
work, and as networks are increased in speed and size.
6.6.1 Performance Problems in Computer Networks
Some performance problems, such as congestion, are caused by temporary re-
source overloads. If more traffic suddenly arrives at a router than the router can
handle, congestion will build up and performance will suffer. We studied conges-
tion in detail in this and the previous chapter.
Performance also degrades when there is a structural resource imbalance. For
example, if a gigabit communication line is attached to a low-end PC, the poor
host will not be able to process the incoming packets fast enough and some will
be lost. These packets will eventually be retransmitted, adding delay, wasting
bandwidth, and generally reducing performance.
Overloads can also be synchronously triggered. As an example, if a segment
contains a bad parameter (e.g., the port for which it is destined), in many cases the
receiver will thoughtfully send back an error notification. Now consider what
could happen if a bad segment is broadcast to 1000 machines: each one might
send back an error message. The resulting broadcast storm could cripple the
network. UDP suffered from this problem until the ICMP protocol was changed
to cause hosts to refrain from responding to errors in UDP segments sent to broad-
cast addresses. Wireless networks must be particularly careful to avoid unchecked
broadcast responses because broadcast occurs naturally and the wireless band-
width is limited.
A second example of synchronous overload is what happens after an electrical
power failure. When the power comes back on, all the machines simultaneously
start rebooting. A typical reboot sequence might require first going to some
(DHCP) server to learn one’s true identity, and then to some file server to get a
copy of the operating system. If hundreds of machines in a data center all do this
at once, the server will probably collapse under the load.

---

## Page 90

584
THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
Even in the absence of synchronous overloads and the presence of sufficient
resources, poor performance can occur due to lack of system tuning. For ex-
ample, if a machine has plenty of CPU power and memory but not enough of the
memory has been allocated for buffer space, flow control will slow down segment
reception and limit performance. This was a problem for many TCP connections
as the Internet became faster but the default size of the flow control window
stayed fixed at 64 KB.
Another tuning issue is setting timeouts. When a segment is sent, a timer is
set to guard against loss of the segment. If the timeout is set too short, unneces-
sary retransmissions will occur, clogging the wires. If the timeout is set too long,
unnecessary delays will occur after a segment is lost. Other tunable parameters
include how long to wait for data on which to piggyback before sending a separate
acknowledgement, and how many retransmissions to make before giving up.
Another performance problem that occurs with real-time applications like
audio and video is jitter. Having enough bandwidth on average is not sufficient
for good performance. Short transmission delays are also required. Consistently
achieving short delays demands careful engineering of the load on the network,
quality-of-service support at the link and network layers, or both.
6.6.2 Network Performance Measurement
When a network performs poorly, its users often complain to the folks running
it, demanding improvements. To improve the performance, the operators must
first determine exactly what is going on. To find out what is really happening, the
operators must make measurements. In this section, we will look at network per-
formance measurements. Much of the discussion below is based on the seminal
work of Mogul (1993).
Measurements can be made in different ways and at many locations (both in
the protocol stack and physically). The most basic kind of measurement is to start
a timer when beginning some activity and see how long that activity takes. For
example, knowing how long it takes for a segment to be acknowledged is a key
measurement. Other measurements are made with counters that record how often
some event has happened (e.g., number of lost segments). Finally, one is often in-
terested in knowing the amount of something, such as the number of bytes proc-
essed in a certain time interval.
Measuring network performance and parameters has many potential pitfalls.
We list a few of them here. Any systematic attempt to measure network per-
formance should be careful to avoid these.
Make Sure That the Sample Size Is Large Enough
Do not measure the time to send one segment, but repeat the measurement,
say, one million times and take the average. Startup effects, such as the 802.16
NIC or cable modem getting a bandwidth reservation after an idle period, can

slow the first segment, and queueing introduces variability. Having a large sam-
ple will reduce the uncertainty in the measured mean and standard deviation. This
uncertainty can be computed using standard statistical formulas.
Make Sure That the Samples Are Representative
Ideally, the whole sequence of one million measurements should be repeated
at different times of the day and the week to see the effect of different network
conditions on the measured quantity. Measurements of congestion, for example,
are of little use if they are made at a moment when there is no congestion. Some-
times the results may be counterintuitive at first, such as heavy congestion at 11
A.M., and 1 P.M., but no congestion at noon (when all the users are at lunch).
With wireless networks, location is an important variable because of signal
propagation. Even a measurement node placed close to a wireless client may not
observe the same packets as the client due to differences in the antennas. It is best
to take measurements from the wireless client under study to see what it sees.
Failing that, it is possible to use techniques to combine the wireless measurements
taken at different vantage points to gain a more complete picture of what is going
on (Mahajan et al., 2006).
Caching Can Wreak Havoc with Measurements
Repeating a measurement many times will return an unexpectedly fast answer
if the protocols use caching mechanisms. For instance, fetching a Web page or
looking up a DNS name (to find the IP address) may involve a network exchange
the first time, and then return the answer from a local cache without sending any
packets over the network. The results from such a measurement are essentially
worthless (unless you want to measure cache performance).
Buffering can have a similar effect. TCP/IP performance tests have been
known to report that UDP can achieve a performance substantially higher than the
network allows. How does this occur? A call to UDP normally returns control as
soon as the message has been accepted by the kernel and added to the transmis-
sion queue. If there is sufficient buffer space, timing 1000 UDP calls does not
mean that all the data have been sent. Most of them may still be in the kernel, but
the performance test program thinks they have all been transmitted.
Caution is advised to be absolutely sure that you understand how data can be
cached and buffered as part of a network operation.
Be Sure That Nothing Unexpected Is Going On during Your Tests
Making measurements at the same time that some user has decided to run a
video conference over your network will often give different results than if there
is no video conference. It is best to run tests on an idle network and create the

---

## Page 92

entire workload yourself. Even this approach has pitfalls, though. While you
might think nobody will be using the network at 3 A.M., that might be when the
automatic backup program begins copying all the disks to tape. Or, there might
be heavy traffic for your wonderful Web pages from distant time zones.
Wireless networks are challenging in this respect because it is often not pos-
sible to separate them from all sources of interference. Even if there are no other
wireless networks sending traffic nearby, someone may microwave popcorn and
inadvertently cause interference that degrades 802.11 performance. For these rea-
sons, it is a good practice to monitor the overall network activity so that you can
at least realize when something unexpected does happen.
Be Careful When Using a Coarse-Grained Clock
Computer clocks function by incrementing some counter at regular intervals.
For example, a millisecond timer adds 1 to a counter every 1 msec. Using such a
timer to measure an event that takes less than 1 msec is possible but requires some
care. Some computers have more accurate clocks, of course, but there are always
shorter events to measure too. Note that clocks are not always as accurate as the
precision with which the time is returned when they are read.
To measure the time to make a TCP connection, for example, the clock (say,
in milliseconds) should be read out when the transport layer code is entered and
again when it is exited. If the true connection setup time is 300 μsec, the dif-
ference between the two readings will be either 0 or 1, both wrong. However, if
the measurement is repeated one million times and the total of all measurements
is added up and divided by one million, the mean time will be accurate to better
than 1 μsec.
Be Careful about Extrapolating the Results
Suppose that you make measurements with simulated network loads running
from 0 (idle) to 0.4 (40% of capacity). For example, the response time to send a
voice-over-IP packet over an 802.11 network might be as shown by the data
points and solid line through them in Fig. 6-49. It may be tempting to extrapolate
linearly, as shown by the dotted line. However, many queueing results involve a
factor of 1/(1 −ρ), where ρ is the load, so the true values may look more like the
dashed line, which rises much faster than linearly when the load gets high. That
is, beware contention effects that become much more pronounced at high load.
6.6.3 Host Design for Fast Networks
Measuring and tinkering can improve performance considerably, but they can-
not substitute for good design in the first place. A poorly designed network can
be improved only so much. Beyond that, it has to be redesigned from scratch.

In this section, we will present some rules of thumb for software imple-
mentation of network protocols on hosts. Surprisingly, experience shows that this
is often a performance bottleneck on otherwise fast networks, for two reasons.
First, NICs (Network Interface Cards) and routers have already been engineered
(with hardware support) to run at ‘‘wire speed.’’ This means that they can process
packets as quickly as the packets can possibly arrive on the link. Second, the
relevant performance is that which applications obtain. It is not the link capacity,
but the throughput and delay after network and transport processing.
Reducing software overheads improves performance by increasing throughput
and decreasing delay. It can also reduce the energy that is spent on networking,
which is an important consideration for mobile computers. Most of these ideas
have been common knowledge to network designers for years. They were first
stated explicitly by Mogul (1993); our treatment largely follows his. Another
relevant source is Metcalfe (1993).
Host Speed Is More Important Than Network Speed
Long experience has shown that in nearly all fast networks, operating system
and protocol overhead dominate actual time on the wire. For example, in theory,
the minimum RPC time on a 1-Gbps Ethernet is 1 μsec, corresponding to a mini-
mum (512-byte) request followed by a minimum (512-byte) reply. In practice,
overcoming the software overhead and getting the RPC time anywhere near there
is a substantial achievement. It rarely happens in practice.

THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
Similarly, the biggest problem in running at 1 Gbps is often getting the bits
from the user’s buffer out onto the network fast enough and having the receiving
host process them as fast as they come in. If you double the host (CPU and mem-
ory) speed, you often can come close to doubling the throughput. Doubling the
network capacity has no effect if the bottleneck is in the hosts.
Reduce Packet Count to Reduce Overhead
Each segment has a certain amount of overhead (e.g., the header) as well as
data (e.g., the payload). Bandwidth is required for both components. Processing is
also required for both components (e.g., header processing and doing the check-
sum). When 1 million bytes are being sent, the data cost is the same no matter
what the segment size is. However, using 128-byte segments means 32 times as
much per-segment overhead as using 4-KB segments. The bandwidth and proc-
essing overheads add up fast to reduce throughput.
Per-packet overhead in the lower layers amplifies this effect. Each arriving
packet causes a fresh interrupt if the host is keeping up. On a modern pipelined
processor, each interrupt breaks the CPU pipeline, interferes with the cache, re-
quires a change to the memory management context, voids the branch prediction
table, and forces a substantial number of CPU registers to be saved. An n-fold re-
duction in segments sent thus reduces the interrupt and packet overhead by a fac-
tor of n.
You might say that both people and computers are poor at multitasking. This
observation underlies the desire to send MTU packets that are as large as will pass
along the network path without fragmentation. Mechanisms such as Nagle’s algo-
rithm and Clark’s solution are also attempts to avoid sending small packets.
Minimize Data Touching
The most straightforward way to implement a layered protocol stack is with
one module for each layer. Unfortunately, this leads to copying (or at least ac-
cessing the data on multiple passes) as each layer does its own work. For ex-
ample, after a packet is received by the NIC, it is typically copied to a kernel buff-
er. From there, it is copied to a network layer buffer for network layer processing,
then to a transport layer buffer for transport layer processing, and finally to the re-
ceiving application process. It is not unusual for an incoming packet to be copied
three or four times before the segment enclosed in it is delivered.
All this copying can greatly degrade performance because memory operations
are an order of magnitude slower than register–register instructions. For example,
if 20% of the instructions actually go to memory (i.e., are cache misses), which is
likely when touching incoming packets, the average instruction execution time is
slowed down by a factor of 2.8 (0.8 × 1 + 0.2 × 10). Hardware assistance will not
help here. The problem is too much copying by the operating system.

---

## Page 95

SEC. 6.6
PERFORMANCE ISSUES
589
A clever operating system will minimize copying by combining the proc-
essing of multiple layers. For example, TCP and IP are usually implemented to-
gether (as ‘‘TCP/IP’’) so that it is not necessary to copy the payload of the packet
as processing switches from network to transport layer. Another common trick is
to perform multiple operations within a layer in a single pass over the data. For
example, checksums are often computed while copying the data (when it has to be
copied) and the newly computed checksum is appended to the end.
Minimize Context Switches
A related rule is that context switches (e.g., from kernel mode to user mode)
are deadly. They have the bad properties of interrupts and copying combined.
This cost is why transport protocols are often implemented in the kernel. Like
reducing packet count, context switches can be reduced by having the library pro-
cedure that sends data do internal buffering until it has a substantial amount of
them. Similarly, on the receiving side, small incoming segments should be col-
lected together and passed to the user in one fell swoop instead of individually, to
minimize context switches.
In the best case, an incoming packet causes a context switch from the current
user to the kernel, and then a switch to the receiving process to give it the newly
arrived data.
Unfortunately, with some operating systems, additional context
switches happen. For example, if the network manager runs as a special process
in user space, a packet arrival is likely to cause a context switch from the current
user to the kernel, then another one from the kernel to the network manager, fol-
lowed by another one back to the kernel, and finally one from the kernel to the re-
ceiving process. This sequence is shown in Fig. 6-50. All these context switches
on each packet are wasteful of CPU time and can have a devastating effect on net-
work performance.

Avoiding Congestion Is Better Than Recovering from It
The old maxim that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure certainly
holds for network congestion. When a network is congested, packets are lost,
bandwidth is wasted, useless delays are introduced, and more. All of these costs
are unnecessary, and recovering from congestion takes time and patience. Not
having it occur in the first place is better. Congestion avoidance is like getting
your DTP vaccination: it hurts a little at the time you get it, but it prevents some-
thing that would hurt a lot more in the future.
Avoid Timeouts
Timers are necessary in networks, but they should be used sparingly and time-
outs should be minimized. When a timer goes off, some action is generally re-
peated. If it is truly necessary to repeat the action, so be it, but repeating it
unnecessarily is wasteful.
The way to avoid extra work is to be careful that timers are set a little bit on
the conservative side. A timer that takes too long to expire adds a small amount
of extra delay to one connection in the (unlikely) event of a segment being lost. A
timer that goes off when it should not have uses up host resources, wastes band-
width, and puts extra load on perhaps dozens of routers for no good reason.
6.6.4 Fast Segment Processing
Now that we have covered general rules, we will look at some specific meth-
ods for speeding up segment processing. For more information, see Clark et al.
(1989), and Chase et al. (2001).
Segment processing overhead has two components: overhead per segment and
overhead per byte. Both must be attacked. The key to fast segment processing is
to separate out the normal, successful case (one-way data transfer) and handle it
specially. Many protocols tend to emphasize what to do when something goes
wrong (e.g., a packet getting lost), but to make the protocols run fast, the designer
should aim to minimize processing time when everything goes right. Minimizing
processing time when an error occurs is secondary.
Although a sequence of special segments is needed to get into the ESTAB-
LISHED state, once there, segment processing is straightforward until one side
starts to close the connection. Let us begin by examining the sending side in the
ESTABLISHED state when there are data to be transmitted. For the sake of clar-
ity, we assume here that the transport entity is in the kernel, although the same
ideas apply if it is a user-space process or a library inside the sending process. In
Fig. 6-51, the sending process traps into the kernel to do the SEND. The first thing
the transport entity does is test to see if this is the normal case: the state is ESTA-
BLISHED, neither side is trying to close the connection, a regular (i.e., not an

out-of-band) full segment is being sent, and enough window space is available at
the receiver. If all conditions are met, no further tests are needed and the fast path
through the sending transport entity can be taken. Typically, this path is taken
most of the time.

Figure 6-51. The fast path from sender to receiver is shown with a heavy line.
The processing steps on this path are shaded.
In the usual case, the headers of consecutive data segments are almost the
same. To take advantage of this fact, a prototype header is stored within the tran-
sport entity. At the start of the fast path, it is copied as fast as possible to a
scratch buffer, word by word. Those fields that change from segment to segment
are overwritten in the buffer. Frequently, these fields are easily derived from state
variables, such as the next sequence number. A pointer to the full segment header
plus a pointer to the user data are then passed to the network layer. Here, the
same strategy can be followed (not shown in Fig. 6-51). Finally, the network
layer gives the resulting packet to the data link layer for transmission.
As an example of how this principle works in practice, let us consider TCP/IP.
Fig. 6-52(a) shows the TCP header. The fields that are the same between consec-
utive segments on a one-way flow are shaded. All the sending transport entity has
to do is copy the five words from the prototype header into the output buffer, fill
in the next sequence number (by copying it from a word in memory), compute the
checksum, and increment the sequence number in memory. It can then hand the
header and data to a special IP procedure for sending a regular, maximum seg-
ment. IP then copies its five-word prototype header [see Fig. 6-52(b)] into the
buffer, fills in the Identification field, and computes its checksum. The packet is
now ready for transmission.
Now let us look at fast path processing on the receiving side of Fig. 6-51.
Step 1 is locating the connection record for the incoming segment. For TCP, the

connection record can be stored in a hash table for which some simple function of
the two IP addresses and two ports is the key. Once the connection record has
been located, both addresses and both ports must be compared to verify that the
correct record has been found.
An optimization that often speeds up connection record lookup even more is
to maintain a pointer to the last one used and try that one first. Clark et al. (1989)
tried this and observed a hit rate exceeding 90%.
The segment is checked to see if it is a normal one: the state is ESTAB-
LISHED, neither side is trying to close the connection, the segment is a full one,
no special flags are set, and the sequence number is the one expected. These tests
take just a handful of instructions. If all conditions are met, a special fast path
TCP procedure is called.
The fast path updates the connection record and copies the data to the user.
While it is copying, it also computes the checksum, eliminating an extra pass over
the data. If the checksum is correct, the connection record is updated and an ac-
knowledgement is sent back. The general scheme of first making a quick check to
see if the header is what is expected and then having a special procedure handle
that case is called header prediction. Many TCP implementations use it. When
this optimization and all the other ones discussed in this chapter are used together,
it is possible to get TCP to run at 90% of the speed of a local memory-to-memory
copy, assuming the network itself is fast enough.
Two other areas where major performance gains are possible are buffer man-
agement and timer management. The issue in buffer management is avoiding
unnecessary copying, as mentioned above. Timer management is important be-
cause nearly all timers set do not expire. They are set to guard against segment
loss, but most segments and their acknowledgements arrive correctly. Hence, it is
important to optimize timer management for the case of timers rarely expiring.
A common scheme is to use a linked list of timer events sorted by expiration
time. The head entry contains a counter telling how many ticks away from expiry
it is. Each successive entry contains a counter telling how many ticks after the

---

SEC. 6.6

593
previous entry it is. Thus, if timers expire in 3, 10, and 12 ticks, respectively, the
three counters are 3, 7, and 2, respectively.
At every clock tick, the counter in the head entry is decremented. When it
hits zero, its event is processed and the next item on the list becomes the head. Its
counter does not have to be changed. This way, inserting and deleting timers are
expensive operations, with execution times proportional to the length of the list.
A much more efficient approach can be used if the maximum timer interval is
bounded and known in advance. Here, an array called a timing wheel can be
used, as shown in Fig. 6-53. Each slot corresponds to one clock tick. The current
time shown is T = 4. Timers are scheduled to expire at 3, 10, and 12 ticks from
now. If a new timer suddenly is set to expire in seven ticks, an entry is just made
in slot 11. Similarly, if the timer set for T + 10 has to be canceled, the list starting
in slot 14 has to be searched and the required entry removed. Note that the array
of Fig. 6-53 cannot accommodate timers beyond T + 15.

When the clock ticks, the current time pointer is advanced by one slot (circu-
larly). If the entry now pointed to is nonzero, all of its timers are processed.
Many variations on the basic idea are discussed by Varghese and Lauck (1987).
6.6.5 Header Compression
We have been looking at fast networks for too long. There is more out there.
Let us now consider performance on wireless and other networks in which band-
width is limited. Reducing software overhead can help mobile computers run

more efficiently, but it does nothing to improve performance when the network
links are the bottleneck.
To use bandwidth well, protocol headers and payloads should be carried with
the minimum of bits. For payloads, this means using compact encodings of infor-
mation, such as images that are in JPEG format rather than a bitmap, or document
formats such as PDF that include compression. It also means application-level
caching mechanisms, such as Web caches that reduce transfers in the first place.
What about for protocol headers? At the link layer, headers for wireless net-
works are typically compact because they were designed with scarce bandwidth in
mind. For example, 802.16 headers have short connection identifiers instead of
longer addresses. However, higher layer protocols such as IP, TCP and UDP
come in one version for all link layers, and they are not designed with compact
headers. In fact, streamlined processing to reduce software overhead often leads
to headers that are not as compact as they could otherwise be (e.g., IPv6 has a
more loosely packed headers than IPv4).
The higher-layer headers can be a significant performance hit. Consider, for
example, voice-over-IP data that is being carried with the combination of IP,
UDP, and RTP. These protocols require 40 bytes of header (20 for IPv4, 8 for
UDP, and 12 for RTP). With IPv6 the situation is even worse: 60 bytes, including
the 40-byte IPv6 header. The headers can wind up as the majority of the trans-
mitted data and consume more than half the bandwidth.
Header compression is used to reduce the bandwidth taken over links by
higher-layer protocol headers. Specially designed schemes are used instead of
general purpose methods. This is because headers are short, so they do not
compress well individually, and decompression requires all prior data to be re-
ceived. This will not be the case if a packet is lost.
Header compression obtains large gains by using knowledge of the protocol
format. One of the first schemes was designed by Van Jacobson (1990) for com-
pressing TCP/IP headers over slow serial links. It is able to compress a typical
TCP/IP header of 40 bytes down to an average of 3 bytes. The trick to this meth-
od is hinted at in Fig. 6-52. Many of the header fields do not change from packet
to packet. There is no need, for example, to send the same IP TTL or the same
TCP port numbers in each and every packet. They can be omitted on the sending
side of the link and filled in on the receiving side.
Similarly, other fields change in a predictable manner. For example, barring
loss, the TCP sequence number advances with the data. In these cases, the re-
ceiver can predict the likely value. The actual number only needs to be carried
when it differs from what is expected. Even then, it may be carried as a small
change from the previous value, as when the acknowledgement number increases
when new data is received in the reverse direction.
With header compression, it is possible to have simple headers in higher-layer
protocols and compact encodings over low bandwidth links. ROHC (RObust
Header Compression) is a modern version of header compression that is defined

595
as a framework in RFC 5795. It is designed to tolerate the loss that can occur on
wireless links. There is a profile for each set of protocols to be compressed, such
as IP/UDP/RTP. Compressed headers are carried by referring to a context, which
is essentially a connection; header fields may easily be predicted for packets of
the same connection, but not for packets of different connections. In typical oper-
ation, ROHC reduces IP/UDP/RTP headers from 40 bytes to 1 to 3 bytes.
While header compression is mainly targeted at reducing bandwidth needs, it
can also be useful for reducing delay. Delay is comprised of propagation delay,
which is fixed given a network path, and transmission delay, which depends on
the bandwidth and amount of data to be sent. For example, a 1-Mbps link sends 1
bit in 1 μsec. In the case of media over wireless networks, the network is relative-
ly slow so transmission delay may be an important factor in overall delay and con-
sistently low delay is important for quality of service.
Header compression can help by reducing the amount of data that is sent, and
hence reducing transmission delay. The same effect can be achieved by sending
smaller packets. This will trade increased software overhead for decreased trans-
mission delay. Note that another potential source of delay is queueing delay to ac-
cess the wireless link. This can also be significant because wireless links are often
heavily used as the limited resource in a network. In this case, the wireless link
must have quality-of-service mechanisms that give low delay to real-time packets.
Header compression alone is not sufficient.
6.6.6 Protocols for Long Fat Networks
Since the 1990s, there have been gigabit networks that transmit data over
large distances. Because of the combination of a fast network, or ‘‘fat pipe,’’ and
long delay, these networks are called long fat networks. When these networks
arose, people’s first reaction was to use the existing protocols on them, but vari-
ous problems quickly arose. In this section, we will discuss some of the problems
with scaling up the speed and delay of network protocols.
The first problem is that many protocols use 32-bit sequence numbers. When
the Internet began, the lines between routers were mostly 56-kbps leased lines, so
a host blasting away at full speed took over 1 week to cycle through the sequence
numbers. To the TCP designers, 232 was a pretty decent approximation of infinity
because there was little danger of old packets still being around a week after they
were transmitted. With 10-Mbps Ethernet, the wrap time became 57 minutes,
much shorter, but still manageable. With a 1-Gbps Ethernet pouring data out onto
the Internet, the wrap time is about 34 seconds, well under the 120-sec maximum
packet lifetime on the Internet. All of a sudden, 232 is not nearly as good an
approximation to infinity since a fast sender can cycle through the sequence space
while old packets still exist.
The problem is that many protocol designers simply assumed, without stating
it, that the time required to use up the entire sequence space would greatly exceed

---

596
THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
the maximum packet lifetime. Consequently, there was no need to even worry
about the problem of old duplicates still existing when the sequence numbers
wrapped around. At gigabit speeds, that unstated assumption fails. Fortunately, it
proved possible to extend the effective sequence number by treating the time-
stamp that can be carried as an option in the TCP header of each packet as the
high-order bits. This mechanism is called PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped
Sequence numbers) and is described in RFC 1323.
A second problem is that the size of the flow control window must be greatly
increased. Consider, for example, sending a 64-KB burst of data from San Diego
to Boston in order to fill the receiver’s 64-KB buffer. Suppose that the link is 1
Gbps and the one-way speed-of-light-in-fiber delay is 20 msec. Initially, at t = 0,
the pipe is empty, as illustrated in Fig. 6-54(a). Only 500 μsec later, in Fig. 6-
54(b), all the segments are out on the fiber. The lead segment will now be some-
where in the vicinity of Brawley, still deep in Southern California. However, the
transmitter must stop until it gets a window update.

back to the sender and the second burst can be transmitted. Since the transmission
line was used for 1.25 msec out of 100, the efficiency is about 1.25%. This situa-
tion is typical of an older protocols running over gigabit lines.
A useful quantity to keep in mind when analyzing network performance is the
bandwidth-delay product.
It is obtained by multiplying the bandwidth (in
bits/sec) by the round-trip delay time (in sec). The product is the capacity of the
pipe from the sender to the receiver and back (in bits).
For the example of Fig. 6-54, the bandwidth-delay product is 40 million bits.
In other words, the sender would have to transmit a burst of 40 million bits to be
able to keep going full speed until the first acknowledgement came back. It takes
this many bits to fill the pipe (in both directions). This is why a burst of half a
million bits only achieves a 1.25% efficiency: it is only 1.25% of the pipe’s capac-
ity.
The conclusion that can be drawn here is that for good performance, the re-
ceiver’s window must be at least as large as the bandwidth-delay product, and
preferably somewhat larger since the receiver may not respond instantly. For a
transcontinental gigabit line, at least 5 MB are required.
A third and related problem is that simple retransmission schemes, such as the
go-back-n protocol, perform poorly on lines with a large bandwidth-delay product.
Consider, the 1-Gbps transcontinental link with a round-trip transmission time of
40 msec. A sender can transmit 5 MB in one round trip. If an error is detected, it
will be 40 msec before the sender is told about it. If go-back-n is used, the sender
will have to retransmit not just the bad packet, but also the 5 MB worth of packets
that came afterward. Clearly, this is a massive waste of resources. More complex
protocols such as selective-repeat are needed.
A fourth problem is that gigabit lines are fundamentally different from mega-
bit lines in that long gigabit lines are delay limited rather than bandwidth limited.
In Fig. 6-55 we show the time it takes to transfer a 1-Mbit file 4000 km at various
transmission speeds. At speeds up to 1 Mbps, the transmission time is dominated
by the rate at which the bits can be sent. By 1 Gbps, the 40-msec round-trip delay
dominates the 1 msec it takes to put the bits on the fiber. Further increases in
bandwidth have hardly any effect at all.
Figure 6-55 has unfortunate implications for network protocols. It says that
stop-and-wait protocols, such as RPC, have an inherent upper bound on their per-
formance. This limit is dictated by the speed of light. No amount of technologi-
cal progress in optics will ever improve matters (new laws of physics would help,
though). Unless some other use can be found for a gigabit line while a host is
waiting for a reply, the gigabit line is no better than a megabit line, just more ex-
pensive.
A fifth problem is that communication speeds have improved faster than com-
puting speeds. (Note to computer engineers: go out and beat those communica-
tion engineers! We are counting on you.) In the 1970s, the ARPANET ran at 56
kbps and had computers that ran at about 1 MIPS. Compare these numbers to

1000-MIPS computers exchanging packets over a 1-Gbps line. The number of in-
structions per byte has decreased by more than a factor of 10. The exact numbers
are debatable depending on dates and scenarios, but the conclusion is this: there is
less time available for protocol processing than there used to be, so protocols must
become simpler.
Let us now turn from the problems to ways of dealing with them. The basic
principle that all high-speed network designers should learn by heart is:
Design for speed, not for bandwidth optimization.
Old protocols were often designed to minimize the number of bits on the wire,
frequently by using small fields and packing them together into bytes and words.
This concern is still valid for wireless networks, but not for gigabit networks.
Protocol processing is the problem, so protocols should be designed to minimize
it. The IPv6 designers clearly understood this principle.
A tempting way to go fast is to build fast network interfaces in hardware. The
difficulty with this strategy is that unless the protocol is exceedingly simple, hard-
ware just means a plug-in board with a second CPU and its own program. To
make sure the network coprocessor is cheaper than the main CPU, it is often a
slower chip. The consequence of this design is that much of the time the main
(fast) CPU is idle waiting for the second (slow) CPU to do the critical work. It is
a myth to think that the main CPU has other work to do while waiting. Fur-
thermore, when two general-purpose CPUs communicate, race conditions can oc-
cur, so elaborate protocols are needed between the two processors to synchronize

them correctly and avoid races. Usually, the best approach is to make the proto-
cols simple and have the main CPU do the work.
Packet layout is an important consideration in gigabit networks. The header
should contain as few fields as possible, to reduce processing time, and these
fields should be big enough to do the job and be word-aligned for fast processing.
In this context, ‘‘big enough’’ means that problems such as sequence numbers
wrapping around while old packets still exist, receivers being unable to advertise
enough window space because the window field is too small, etc. do not occur.
The maximum data size should be large, to reduce software overhead and per-
mit efficient operation. 1500 bytes is too small for high-speed networks, which is
why gigabit Ethernet supports jumbo frames of up to 9 KB and IPv6 supports
jumbogram packets in excess of 64 KB.
Let us now look at the issue of feedback in high-speed protocols. Due to the
(relatively) long delay loop, feedback should be avoided: it takes too long for the
receiver to signal the sender. One example of feedback is governing the transmis-
sion rate by using a sliding window protocol. Future protocols may switch to
rate-based protocols to avoid the (long) delays inherent in the receiver sending
window updates to the sender. In such a protocol, the sender can send all it wants
to, provided it does not send faster than some rate the sender and receiver have
agreed upon in advance.
A second example of feedback is Jacobson’s slow start algorithm. This algo-
rithm makes multiple probes to see how much the network can handle. With
high-speed networks, making half a dozen or so small probes to see how the net-
work responds wastes a huge amount of bandwidth. A more efficient scheme is to
have the sender, receiver, and network all reserve the necessary resources at con-
nection setup time. Reserving resources in advance also has the advantage of ma-
king it easier to reduce jitter. In short, going to high speeds inexorably pushes the
design toward connection-oriented operation, or something fairly close to it.
Another valuable feature is the ability to send a normal amount of data along
with the connection request. In this way, one round-trip time can be saved.
6.7 DELAY-TOLERANT NETWORKING
We will finish this chapter by describing a new kind of transport that may one
day be an important component of the Internet. TCP and most other transport pro-
tocols are based on the assumption that the sender and the receiver are continu-
ously connected by some working path, or else the protocol fails and data cannot
be delivered. In some networks there is often no end-to-end path. An example is a
space network as LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) satellites pass in and out of range of
ground stations. A given satellite may be able to communicate to a ground station
only at particular times, and two satellites may never be able to communicate with
each other at any time, even via a ground station, because one of the satellites

may always be out of range. Other example networks involve submarines, buses,
mobile phones, and other devices with computers for which there is intermittent
connectivity due to mobility or extreme conditions.
In these occasionally connected networks, data can still be communicated by
storing them at nodes and forwarding them later when there is a working link.
This technique is called message switching. Eventually the data will be relayed
to the destination. A network whose architecture is based on this approach is call-
ed a DTN (Delay-Tolerant Network, or a Disruption-Tolerant Network).
Work on DTNs started in 2002 when IETF set up a research group on the
topic. The inspiration for DTNs came from an unlikely source: efforts to send
packets in space. Space networks must deal with intermittent communication and
very long delays. Kevin Fall observed that the ideas for these Interplanetary In-
ternets could be applied to networks on Earth in which intermittent connectivity
was the norm (Fall, 2003). This model gives a useful generalization of the Inter-
net in which storage and delays can occur during communication. Data delivery
is akin to delivery in the postal system, or electronic mail, rather than packet
switching at routers.
Since 2002, the DTN architecture has been refined, and the applications of the
DTN model have grown. As a mainstream application, consider large datasets of
many terabytes that are produced by scientific experiments, media events, or
Web-based services and need to be copied to datacenters at different locations
around the world. Operators would like to send this bulk traffic at off-peak times
to make use of bandwidth that has already been paid for but is not being used, and
are willing to tolerate some delay. It is like doing the backups at night when other
applications are not making heavy use of the network. The problem is that, for
global services, the off-peak times are different at locations around the world.
There may be little overlap in the times when datacenters in Boston and Perth
have off-peak network bandwidth because night for one city is day for the other.
However, DTN models allow for storage and delays during transfer. With
this model, it becomes possible to send the dataset from Boston to Amsterdam
using off-peak bandwidth, as the cities have time zones that are only 6 hours
apart. The dataset is then stored in Amsterdam until there is off-peak bandwidth
between Amsterdam and Perth. It is then sent to Perth to complete the transfer.
Laoutaris et al. (2009) have studied this model and find that it can provide sub-
stantial capacity at little cost, and that the use of a DTN model often doubles that
capacity compared with a traditional end-to-end model.
In what follows, we will describe the IETF DTN architecture and protocols.
6.7.1 DTN Architecture
The main assumption in the Internet that DTNs seek to relax is that an end-
to-end path between a source and a destination exists for the entire duration of a
communication session. When this is not the case, the normal Internet protocols

fail. DTNs get around the lack of end-to-end connectivity with an architecture
that is based on message switching, as shown in Fig. 6-56. It is also intended to
tolerate links with low reliability and large delays. The architecture is specified in
RFC 4838.

Figure 6-56. Delay-tolerant networking architecture.
In DTN terminology, a message is called a bundle. DTN nodes are equipped
with storage, typically persistent storage such as a disk or flash memory. They
store bundles until links become available and then forward the bundles. The links
work intermittently. Fig. 6-56 shows five intermittent links that are not currently
working, and two links that are working. A working link is called a contact.
Fig. 6-56 also shows bundles stored at two DTN nodes awaiting contacts to send
the bundles onward. In this way, the bundles are relayed via contacts from the
source to their destination.
The storing and forwarding of bundles at DTN nodes sounds similar to the
queueing and forwarding of packets at routers, but there are qualitative dif-
ferences. In routers in the Internet, queueing occurs for milliseconds or at most
seconds. At DTN nodes, bundles may be stored for hours, until a bus arrives in
town, while an airplane completes a flight, until a sensor node harvests enough
solar energy to run, until a sleeping computer wakes up, and so forth. These ex-
amples also point to a second difference, which is that nodes may move (with a
bus or plane) while they hold stored data, and this movement may even be a key
part of data delivery. Routers in the Internet are not allowed to move. The whole
process of moving bundles might be better known as ‘‘store-carry-forward.’’
As an example, consider the scenario shown in Fig. 6-57 that was the first use
of DTN protocols in space (Wood et al., 2008). The source of bundles is an LEO
satellite that is recording Earth images as part of the Disaster Monitoring Constel-
lation of satellites. The images must be returned to the collection point. However,
the satellite has only intermittent contact with three ground stations as it orbits the
Earth. It comes into contact with each ground station in turn. Each of the satellite,
ground stations, and collection point act as a DTN node. At each contact, a

bundle (or a portion of a bundle) is sent to a ground station. The bundles are then
sent over a backhaul terrestrial network to the collection point to complete the
transfer.

The primary advantage of the DTN architecture in this example is that it nat-
urally fits the situation of the satellite needing to store images because there is no
connectivity at the time the image is taken. There are two further advantages.
First, there may be no single contact long enough to send the images. However,
they can be spread across the contacts with three ground stations. Second, the use
of the link between the satellite and ground station is decoupled from the link over
the backhaul network. This means that the satellite download is not limited by a
slow terrestrial link. It can proceed at full speed, with the bundle stored at the
ground station until it can be relayed to the collection point.
An important issue that is not specified by the architecture is how to find good
routes via DTN nodes. A route in this path to use. Good routes depend on the
nature of the architecture describes when to send data, and also which contacts.
Some contacts are known ahead of time. A good example is the motion of
heavenly bodies in the space example. For the space experiment, it was known
ahead of time when contacts would occur, that the contact intervals ranged from 5
to 14 minutes per pass with each ground station, and that the downlink capacity
was 8.134 Mbps. Given this knowledge, the transport of a bundle of images can
be planned ahead of time.
In other cases, the contacts can be predicted, but with less certainty. Examples
include buses that make contact with each other in mostly regular ways, due to a
timetable, yet with some variation, and the times and amount of off-peak band-
width in ISP networks, which are predicted from past data. At the other extreme,
the contacts are occasional and random. One example is carrying data from user

to user on mobile phones depending on which users make contact with each other
during the day. When there is unpredictability in contacts, one routing strategy is
to send copies of the bundle along different paths in the hope that one of the cop-
ies is delivered to the destination before the lifetime is reached.
6.7.2 The Bundle Protocol
To take a closer look at the operation of DTNs, we will now look at the IETF
protocols. DTNs are an emerging kind of network, and experimental DTNs have
used different protocols, as there is no requirement that the IETF protocols be
used. However, they are at least a good place to start and highlight many of the
key issues.
The DTN protocol stack is shown in Fig. 6-58. The key protocol is the Bun-
dle protocol, which is specified in RFC 5050. It is responsible for accepting mes-
sages from the application and sending them as one or more bundles via store-
carry-forward operations to the destination DTN node. It is also apparent from
Fig. 6-58 that the Bundle protocol runs above the level of TCP/IP. In other words,
TCP/IP may be used over each contact to move bundles between DTN nodes.
This positioning raises the issue of whether the Bundle protocol is a transport
layer protocol or an application layer protocol. Just as with RTP, we take the
position that, despite running over a transport protocol, the Bundle protocol is pro-
viding a transport service to many different applications, and so we cover DTNs
in this chapter.

In Fig. 6-58, we see that the Bundle protocol may be run over other kinds of
protocols such as UDP, or even other kinds of internets. For example, in a space
network the links may have very long delays. The round-trip time between Earth
and Mars can easily be 20 minutes depending on the relative position of the
planets. Imagine how well TCP acknowledgements and retransmissions will work
over that link, especially for relatively short messages. Not well at all. Instead,

another protocol that uses error-correcting codes might be used. Or in sensor net-
works that are very resource constrained, a more lightweight protocol than TCP
may be used.
Since the Bundle protocol is fixed, yet it is intended to run over a variety of
transports, there is must be a gap in functionality between the protocols. That gap
is the reason for the inclusion of a convergence layer in Fig. 6-58. The conver-
gence layer is just a glue layer that matches the interfaces of the protocols that it
joins. By definition there is a different convergence layer for each different lower
layer transport. Convergence layers are commonly found in standards to join new
and existing protocols.
The format of Bundle protocol messages is shown in Fig. 6-59. The different
fields in these messages tell us some of the key issues that are handled by the
Bundle protocol.

Figure 6-59. Bundle protocol message format.
Each message consists of a primary block, which can be thought of as a head-
er, a payload block for the data, and optionally other blocks, for example to carry
security parameters. The primary block begins with a Version field (currently 6)
followed by a Flags field. Among other functions, the flags encode a class of ser-
vice to let a source mark its bundles as higher or lower priority, and other han-
dling requests such as whether the destination should acknowledge the bundle.
Then come addresses, which highlight three interesting parts of the design. As
well as a Destination and Source identifier field, there is a Custodian identifier.
The custodian is the party responsible for seeing that the bundle is delivered. In
the Internet, the source node is usually the custodian, as it is the node that retrans-
mits if the data is not ultimately delivered to the destination. However, in a DTN,
the source node may not always be connected and may have no way of knowing
whether the data has been delivered. DTNs deal with this problem using the
notion of custody transfer, in which another node, closer to the destination, can
assume responsibility for seeing the data safely delivered. For example, if a bun-
dle is stored on an airplane for forwarding at a later time and location, the airplane
may become the custodian of the bundle.

605
The second interesting aspect is that these identifiers are not IP addresses. Be-
cause the Bundle protocol is intended to work across a variety of transports and
internets, it defines its own identifiers. These identifiers are really more like
high-level names, such as Web page URLs, than low-level addresses, such as IP
addresses. They give DTNs an aspect of application-level routing, such as email
delivery or the distribution of software updates.
The third interesting aspect is the way the identifiers are encoded. There is
also a Report identifier for diagnostic messages. All of the identifiers are encoded
as references to a variable length Dictionary field. This provides compression
when the custodian or report nodes are the same as the source or the destination.
In fact, much of the message format has been designed with both extensibility and
efficiency in mind by using a compact representation of variable length fields.
The compact representation is important for wireless links and resource-
constrained nodes such as in a sensor network.
Next comes a Creation field carrying the time at which the bundle was creat-
ed, along with a sequence number from the source for ordering, plus a Lifetime
field that tells the time at which the bundle data is no longer useful. These fields
exist because data may be stored for a long period at DTN nodes and there must
be some way to remove stale data from the network. Unlike the Internet, they re-
quire that DTN nodes have loosely synchronized clocks.
The primary block is completed with the Dictionary field. Then comes the
payload block. This block starts with a short Type field that identifies it as a pay-
load, followed by a small set of Flags that describe processing options. Then
comes the Data field, preceded by a Length field. Finally, there may be other, op-
tional blocks, such as a block that carries security parameters.
Many aspects of DTNs are being explored in the research community. Good
strategies for routing depend on the nature of the contacts, as was mentioned
above. Storing data inside the network raises other issues. Now congestion control
must consider storage at nodes as another kind of resource that can be depleted.
The lack of end-to-end communication also exacerbates security problems. Before
a DTN node takes custody of a bundle, it may want to know that the sender is
authorized to use the network and that the bundle is probably wanted by the desti-
nation. Solutions to these problems will depend on the kind of DTN, as space net-
works are different from sensor networks.
6.8 SUMMARY
The transport layer is the key to understanding layered protocols. It provides
various services, the most important of which is an end-to-end, reliable, con-
nection-oriented byte stream from sender to receiver. It is accessed through ser-
vice primitives that permit the establishment, use, and release of connections. A
common transport layer interface is the one provided by Berkeley sockets.

THE TRANSPORT LAYER
CHAP. 6
Transport protocols must be able to do connection management over unre-
liable networks. Connection establishment is complicated by the existence of de-
layed duplicate packets that can reappear at inopportune moments. To deal with
them, three-way handshakes are needed to establish connections. Releasing a
connection is easier than establishing one but is still far from trivial due to the
two-army problem.
Even when the network layer is completely reliable, the transport layer has
plenty of work to do. It must handle all the service primitives, manage connec-
tions and timers, allocate bandwidth with congestion control, and run a variable-
sized sliding window for flow control.
Congestion control should allocate all of the available bandwidth between
competing flows fairly, and it should track changes in the usage of the network.
The AIMD control law converges to a fair and efficient allocation.
The Internet has two main transport protocols: UDP and TCP. UDP is a con-
nectionless protocol that is mainly a wrapper for IP packets with the additional
feature of multiplexing and demultiplexing multiple processes using a single IP
address. UDP can be used for client-server interactions, for example, using RPC.
It can also be used for building real-time protocols such as RTP.
The main Internet transport protocol is TCP. It provides a reliable, bidirec-
tional, congestion-controlled byte stream with a 20-byte header on all segments.
A great deal of work has gone into optimizing TCP performance, using algorithms
from Nagle, Clark, Jacobson, Karn, and others.
Network performance is typically dominated by protocol and segment proc-
essing overhead, and this situation gets worse at higher speeds. Protocols should
be designed to minimize the number of segments and work for large bandwidth-
delay paths. For gigabit networks, simple protocols and streamlined processing
are called for.
Delay-tolerant networking provides a delivery service across networks that
have occasional connectivity or long delays across links. Intermediate nodes
store, carry, and forward bundles of information so that it is eventually delivered,
even if there is no working path from sender to receiver at any time.
PROBLEMS
1. In our example transport primitives of Fig. 6-2, LISTEN is a blocking call. Is this
strictly necessary? If not, explain how a nonblocking primitive could be used. What
advantage would this have over the scheme described in the text?
2. Primitives of transport service assume asymmetry between the two end points during
connection establishment, one end (server) executes LISTEN while the other end
(client) executes CONNECT. However, in peer to peer applications such file sharing

systems, e.g. BitTorrent, all end points are peers. There is no server or client func-
tionality. How can transport service primitives may be used to build such peer to peer
applications?
3. In the underlying model of Fig. 6-4, it is assumed that packets may be lost by the net-
work layer and thus must be individually acknowledged. Suppose that the network
layer is 100 percent reliable and never loses packets. What changes, if any, are
needed to Fig. 6-4?
4. In both parts of Fig. 6-6, there is a comment that the value of SERVER PORT must be
the same in both client and server. Why is this so important?
5. In the Internet File Server example (Figure 6-6), can the connect( ) system call on the
client fail for any reason other than listen queue being full on the server? Assume that
the network is perfect.
6. One criteria for deciding whether to have a server active all the time or have it start on
demand using a process server is how frequently the service provided is used. Can
you think of any other criteria for making this decision?
7. Suppose that the clock-driven scheme for generating initial sequence numbers is used
with a 15-bit wide clock counter. The clock ticks once every 100 msec, and the max-
imum packet lifetime is 60 sec. How often need resynchronization take place
(a) in the worst case?
(b) when the data consumes 240 sequence numbers/min?
8. Why does the maximum packet lifetime, T, have to be large enough to ensure that not
only the packet but also its acknowledgements have vanished?
9. Imagine that a two-way handshake rather than a three-way handshake were used to set
up connections. In other words, the third message was not required. Are deadlocks
now possible? Give an example or show that none exist.
10. Imagine a generalized n-army problem, in which the agreement of any two of the blue
armies is sufficient for victory. Does a protocol exist that allows blue to win?
11. Consider the problem of recovering from host crashes (i.e., Fig. 6-18). If the interval
between writing and sending an acknowledgement, or vice versa, can be made rela-
tively small, what are the two best sender-receiver strategies for minimizing the
chance of a protocol failure?
12. In Figure 6-20, suppose a new flow E is added that takes a path from R1 to R2 to R6.
How does the max-min bandwidth allocation change for the five flows?
13. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of credits versus sliding window protocols.
14. Some other policies for fairness in congestion control are Additive Increase Additive
Decrease (AIAD), Multiplicative Increase Additive Decrease (MIAD), and Multipli-
cative Increase Multiplicative Decrease (MIMD). Discuss these three policies in terms
of convergence and stability.
15. Why does UDP exist? Would it not have been enough to just let user processes send
raw IP packets?

16. Consider a simple application-level protocol built on top of UDP that allows a client to
retrieve a file from a remote server residing at a well-known address. The client first
sends a request with a file name, and the server responds with a sequence of data
packets containing different parts of the requested file. To ensure reliability and
sequenced delivery, client and server use a stop-and-wait protocol. Ignoring the obvi-
ous performance issue, do you see a problem with this protocol? Think carefully
about the possibility of processes crashing.
17. A client sends a 128-byte request to a server located 100 km away over a 1-gigabit
optical fiber. What is the efficiency of the line during the remote procedure call?
18. Consider the situation of the previous problem again. Compute the minimum possible
response time both for the given 1-Gbps line and for a 1-Mbps line. What conclusion
can you draw?
19. Both UDP and TCP use port numbers to identify the destination entity when deliver-
ing a message. Give two reasons why these protocols invented a new abstract ID (port
numbers), instead of using process IDs, which already existed when these protocols
were designed.
20. Several RPC implementations provide an option to the client to use RPC implemented
over UDP or RPC implemented over TCP. Under what conditions will a client prefer
to use RPC over UDP and under what conditions will he prefer to use RPC over TCP?
21. Consider two networks, N 1 and N 2, that have the same average delay between a
source A and a destination D. In N 1, the delay experienced by different packets is
unformly distributed with maximum delay being 10 seconds, while in N 2, 99% of the
packets experience less than one second delay with no limit on maximum delay. Dis-
cuss how RTP may be used in these two cases to transmit live audio/video stream.
22. What is the total size of the minimum TCP MTU, including TCP and IP overhead but
not including data link layer overhead?
23. Datagram fragmentation and reassembly are handled by IP and are invisible to TCP.
Does this mean that TCP does not have to worry about data arriving in the wrong
order?
24. RTP is used to transmit CD-quality audio, which makes a pair of 16-bit samples
44,100 times/sec, one sample for each of the stereo channels. How many packets per
second must RTP transmit?
25. Would it be possible to place the RTP code in the operating system kernel, along with
the UDP code? Explain your answer.
26. A process on host 1 has been assigned port p, and a process on host 2 has been
assigned port q. Is it possible for there to be two or more TCP connections between
these two ports at the same time?
27. In Fig. 6-36 we saw that in addition to the 32-bit acknowledgement field, there is an
ACK bit in the fourth word. Does this really add anything? Why or why not?
28. The maximum payload of a TCP segment is 65,495 bytes. Why was such a strange
number chosen?

29. Describe two ways to get into the SYN RCVD state of Fig. 6-39.
30. Consider the effect of using slow start on a line with a 10-msec round-trip time and no
congestion. The receive window is 24 KB and the maximum segment size is 2 KB.
How long does it take before the first full window can be sent?
31. Suppose that the TCP congestion window is set to 18 KB and a timeout occurs. How
big will the window be if the next four transmission bursts are all successful? Assume
that the maximum segment size is 1 KB.
32. If the TCP round-trip time, RTT, is currently 30 msec and the following acknowledge-
ments come in after 26, 32, and 24 msec, respectively, what is the new RTT estimate
using the Jacobson algorithm? Use α = 0.9.
33. A TCP machine is sending full windows of 65,535 bytes over a 1-Gbps channel that
has a 10-msec one-way delay. What is the maximum throughput achievable? What is
the line efficiency?
34. What is the fastest line speed at which a host can blast out 1500-byte TCP payloads
with a 120-sec maximum packet lifetime without having the sequence numbers wrap
around? Take TCP, IP, and Ethernet overhead into consideration. Assume that Ether-
net frames may be sent continuously.
35. To address the limitations of IP version 4, a major effort had to be undertaken via
IETF that resulted in the design of IP version 6 and there are still is significant reluc-
tance in the adoption of this new version. However, no such major effort is needed to
address the limitations of TCP. Explain why this is the case.
36. In a network whose max segment is 128 bytes, max segment lifetime is 30 sec, and
has 8-bit sequence numbers, what is the maximum data rate per connection?
37. Suppose that you are measuring the time to receive a segment. When an interrupt
occurs, you read out the system clock in milliseconds. When the segment is fully pro-
cessed, you read out the clock again. You measure 0 msec 270,000 times and 1 msec
730,000 times. How long does it take to receive a segment?
38. A CPU executes instructions at the rate of 1000 MIPS. Data can be copied 64 bits at a
time, with each word copied costing 10 instructions. If an coming packet has to be
copied four times, can this system handle a 1-Gbps line? For simplicity, assume that
all instructions, even those instructions that read or write memory, run at the full
1000-MIPS rate.
39. To get around the problem of sequence numbers wrapping around while old packets
still exist, one could use 64-bit sequence numbers. However, theoretically, an optical
fiber can run at 75 Tbps. What maximum packet lifetime is required to make sure that
future 75-Tbps networks do not have wraparound problems even with 64-bit sequence
numbers? Assume that each byte has its own sequence number, as TCP does.
40. In Sec. 6.6.5, we calculated that a gigabit line dumps 80,000 packets/sec on the host,
giving it only 6250 instructions to process it and leaving half the CPU time for appli-
cations. This calculation assumed a 1500-byte packet. Redo the calculation for an
ARPANET-sized packet (128 bytes). In both cases, assume that the packet sizes
given include all overhead.

41. For a 1-Gbps network operating over 4000 km, the delay is the limiting factor, not the
bandwidth. Consider a MAN with the average source and destination 20 km apart. At
what data rate does the round-trip delay due to the speed of light equal the transmis-
sion delay for a 1-KB packet?
42. Calculate the bandwidth-delay product for the following networks: (1) T1 (1.5 Mbps),
(2) Ethernet (10 Mbps), (3) T3 (45 Mbps), and (4) STS-3 (155 Mbps). Assume an
RTT of 100 msec. Recall that a TCP header has 16 bits reserved for Window Size.
What are its implications in light of your calculations?
43. What is the bandwidth-delay product for a 50-Mbps channel on a geostationary satel-
lite? If the packets are all 1500 bytes (including overhead), how big should the win-
dow be in packets?
44. The file server of Fig. 6-6 is far from perfect and could use a few improvements.
Make the following modifications.
(a) Give the client a third argument that specifies a byte range.
(b) Add a client flag –w that allows the file to be written to the server.
45. One common function that all network protocols need is to manipulate messages.
Recall that protocols manipulate messages by adding/striping headers. Some protocols
may break a single message into multiple fragments, and later join these multiple frag-
ments back into a single message. To this end, design and implement a message
management library that provides support for creating a new message, attaching a
header to a message, stripping a header from a message, breaking a message into two
messages, combining two messages into a single message, and saving a copy of a mes-
sage. Your implementation must minimize data copying from one buffer to another as
much as possible. It is critical that the operations that manipulate messages do not
touch the data in a message, but rather, only manipulate pointers.
46. Design and implement a chat system that allows multiple groups of users to chat. A
chat coordinator resides at a well-known network address, uses UDP for communica-
tion with chat clients, sets up chat servers for each chat session, and maintains a chat
session directory. There is one chat server per chat session. A chat server uses TCP
for communication with clients. A chat client allows users to start, join, and leave a
chat session. Design and implement the coordinator, server, and client code.
