THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL
SUBLAYER
Network links can be divided into two categories: those using point-to-point
connections and those using broadcast channels. We studied point-to-point links
in Chap. 2; this chapter deals with broadcast links and their protocols.
In any broadcast network, the key issue is how to determine who gets to use
the channel when there is competition for it. To make this point, consider a con-
ference call in which six people, on six different telephones, are all connected so
that each one can hear and talk to all the others. It is very likely that when one of
them stops speaking, two or more will start talking at once, leading to chaos. In a
face-to-face meeting, chaos is avoided by external means. For example, at a meet-
ing, people raise their hands to request permission to speak. When only a single
channel is available, it is much harder to determine who should go next. Many
protocols for solving the problem are known. They form the contents of this chap-
ter. In the literature, broadcast channels are sometimes referred to as multiaccess
channels or random access channels.
The protocols used to determine who goes next on a multiaccess channel be-
long to a sublayer of the data link layer called the MAC (Medium Access Con-
trol) sublayer. The MAC sublayer is especially important in LANs, particularly
wireless ones because wireless is naturally a broadcast channel. WANs, in con-
trast, use point-to-point links, except for satellite networks. Because multiaccess
channels and LANs are so closely related, in this chapter we will discuss LANs in

general, including a few issues that are not strictly part of the MAC sublayer, but
the main subject here will be control of the channel.
Technically, the MAC sublayer is the bottom part of the data link layer, so
logically we should have studied it before examining all the point-to-point proto-
cols in Chap. 3. Nevertheless, for most people, it is easier to understand protocols
involving multiple parties after two-party protocols are well understood. For that
reason we have deviated slightly from a strict bottom-up order of presentation.
4.1 THE CHANNEL ALLOCATION PROBLEM
The central theme of this chapter is how to allocate a single broadcast channel
among competing users. The channel might be a portion of the wireless spectrum
in a geographic region, or a single wire or optical fiber to which multiple nodes
are connected. It does not matter. In both cases, the channel connects each user to
all other users and any user who makes full use of the channel interferes with
other users who also wish to use the channel.
We will first look at the shortcomings of static allocation schemes for bursty
traffic. Then, we will lay out the key assumptions used to model the dynamic
schemes that we examine in the following sections.
4.1.1 Static Channel Allocation
The traditional way of allocating a single channel, such as a telephone trunk,
among multiple competing users is to chop up its capacity by using one of the
multiplexing schemes we described in Sec. 2.5, such as FDM (Frequency Division
Multiplexing). If there are N users, the bandwidth is divided into N equal-sized
portions, with each user being assigned one portion. Since each user has a private
frequency band, there is now no interference among users. When there is only a
small and constant number of users, each of which has a steady stream or a heavy
load of traffic, this division is a simple and efficient allocation mechanism. A
wireless example is FM radio stations. Each station gets a portion of the FM band
and uses it most of the time to broadcast its signal.
However, when the number of senders is large and varying or the traffic is
bursty, FDM presents some problems. If the spectrum is cut up into N regions and
fewer than N users are currently interested in communicating, a large piece of
valuable spectrum will be wasted. And if more than N users want to communi-
cate, some of them will be denied permission for lack of bandwidth, even if some
of the users who have been assigned a frequency band hardly ever transmit or re-
ceive anything.
Even assuming that the number of users could somehow be held constant at N,
dividing the single available channel into some number of static subchannels is

inherently inefficient. The basic problem is that when some users are quiescent,
their bandwidth is simply lost. They are not using it, and no one else is allowed to
use it either. A static allocation is a poor fit to most computer systems, in which
data traffic is extremely bursty, often with peak traffic to mean traffic ratios of
1000:1. Consequently, most of the channels will be idle most of the time.
The poor performance of static FDM can easily be seen with a simple queue-
ing theory calculation. Let us start by finding the mean time delay, T, to send a
frame onto a channel of capacity C bps. We assume that the frames arrive ran-
domly with an average arrival rate of λ frames/sec, and that the frames vary in
length with an average length of 1/μ bits. With these parameters, the service rate
of the channel is μC frames/sec. A standard queueing theory result is
T = μC −λ
1
(For the curious, this result is for an ‘‘M/M/1’’ queue. It requires that the ran-
domness of the times between frame arrivals and the frame lengths follow an
exponential distribution, or equivalently be the result of a Poisson process.)
In our example, if C is 100 Mbps, the mean frame length, 1/μ, is 10,000 bits,
and the frame arrival rate, λ, is 5000 frames/sec, then T = 200 μsec. Note that if
we ignored the queueing delay and just asked how long it takes to send a 10,000-
bit frame on a 100-Mbps network, we would get the (incorrect) answer of 100
μsec. That result only holds when there is no contention for the channel.
Now let us divide the single channel into N independent subchannels, each
with capacity C /N bps. The mean input rate on each of the subchannels will now
be λ/N. Recomputing T, we get
TN = μ(C /N) −(λ/N)
1
= μC −λ
N
= NT
(4-1)
The mean delay for the divided channel is N times worse than if all the frames
were somehow magically arranged orderly in a big central queue. This same result
says that a bank lobby full of ATM machines is better off having a single queue
feeding all the machines than a separate queue in front of each machine.
Precisely the same arguments that apply to FDM also apply to other ways of
statically dividing the channel. If we were to use time division multiplexing
(TDM) and allocate each user every Nth time slot, if a user does not use the allo-
cated slot, it would just lie fallow. The same would hold if we split up the net-
works physically. Using our previous example again, if we were to replace the
100-Mbps network with 10 networks of 10 Mbps each and statically allocate each
user to one of them, the mean delay would jump from 200 μsec to 2 msec.
Since none of the traditional static channel allocation methods work well at all
with bursty traffic, we will now explore dynamic methods.

4.1.2 Assumptions for Dynamic Channel Allocation
Before we get to the first of the many channel allocation methods in this chap-
ter, it is worthwhile to carefully formulate the allocation problem. Underlying all
the work done in this area are the following five key assumptions:
1.
Independent Traffic. The model consists of N independent stations
(e.g., computers, telephones), each with a program or user that gener-
ates frames for transmission. The expected number of frames gener-
ated in an interval of length Δt is λΔt, where λ is a constant (the arri-
val rate of new frames). Once a frame has been generated, the sta-
tion is blocked and does nothing until the frame has been suc-
cessfully transmitted.
2.
Single Channel. A single channel is available for all communica-
tion. All stations can transmit on it and all can receive from it. The
stations are assumed to be equally capable, though protocols may
assign them different roles (e.g., priorities).
3.
Observable Collisions.
If two frames are transmitted simultan-
eously, they overlap in time and the resulting signal is garbled. This
event is called a collision. All stations can detect that a collision has
occurred. A collided frame must be transmitted again later. No er-
rors other than those generated by collisions occur.
4.
Continuous or Slotted Time. Time may be assumed continuous, in
which case frame transmission can begin at any instant. Alterna-
tively, time may be slotted or divided into discrete intervals (called
slots). Frame transmissions must then begin at the start of a slot. A
slot may contain 0, 1, or more frames, corresponding to an idle slot, a
successful transmission, or a collision, respectively.
5.
Carrier Sense or No Carrier Sense. With the carrier sense as-
sumption, stations can tell if the channel is in use before trying to use
it. No station will attempt to use the channel while it is sensed as
busy. If there is no carrier sense, stations cannot sense the channel
before trying to use it. They just go ahead and transmit. Only later
can they determine whether the transmission was successful.
Some discussion of these assumptions is in order. The first one says that
frame arrivals are independent, both across stations and at a particular station, and
that frames are generated unpredictably but at a constant rate. Actually, this as-
sumption is not a particularly good model of network traffic, as it is well known
that packets come in bursts over a range of time scales (Paxson and Floyd, 1995;
and Leland et al., 1994). Nonetheless, Poisson models, as they are frequently
called, are useful because they are mathematically tractable. They help us analyze

protocols to understand roughly how performance changes over an operating
range and how it compares with other designs.
The single-channel assumption is the heart of the model. No external ways to
communicate exist. Stations cannot raise their hands to request that the teacher
call on them, so we will have to come up with better solutions.
The remaining three assumptions depend on the engineering of the system,
and we will say which assumptions hold when we examine a particular protocol.
The collision assumption is basic. Stations need some way to detect collisions
if they are to retransmit frames rather than let them be lost. For wired channels,
node hardware can be designed to detect collisions when they occur. The stations
can then terminate their transmissions prematurely to avoid wasting capacity.
This detection is much harder for wireless channels, so collisions are usually
inferred after the fact by the lack of an expected acknowledgement frame. It is
also possible for some frames involved in a collision to be successfully received,
depending on the details of the signals and the receiving hardware. However, this
situation is not the common case, so we will assume that all frames involved in a
collision are lost. We will also see protocols that are designed to prevent collis-
ions from occurring in the first place.
The reason for the two alternative assumptions about time is that slotted time
can be used to improve performance. However, it requires the stations to follow a
master clock or synchronize their actions with each other to divide time into dis-
crete intervals. Hence, it is not always available. We will discuss and analyze
systems with both kinds of time. For a given system, only one of them holds.
Similarly, a network may have carrier sensing or not have it. Wired networks
will generally have carrier sense. Wireless networks cannot always use it ef-
fectively because not every station may be within radio range of every other sta-
tion. Similarly, carrier sense will not be available in other settings in which a sta-
tion cannot communicate directly with other stations, for example a cable modem
in which stations must communicate via the cable headend. Note that the word
‘‘carrier’’ in this sense refers to a signal on the channel and has nothing to do with
the common carriers (e.g., telephone companies) that date back to the days of the
Pony Express.
To avoid any misunderstanding, it is worth noting that no multiaccess proto-
col guarantees reliable delivery. Even in the absence of collisions, the receiver
may have copied some of the frame incorrectly for various reasons. Other parts of
the link layer or higher layers provide reliability.
4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESS PROTOCOLS
Many algorithms for allocating a multiple access channel are known. In the
following sections, we will study a small sample of the more interesting ones and
give some examples of how they are commonly used in practice.

4.2.1 ALOHA
The story of our first MAC starts out in pristine Hawaii in the early 1970s. In
this case, ‘‘pristine’’ can be interpreted as ‘‘not having a working telephone sys-
tem.’’ This did not make life more pleasant for researcher Norman Abramson and
his colleagues at the University of Hawaii who were trying to connect users on re-
mote islands to the main computer in Honolulu. Stringing their own cables under
the Pacific Ocean was not in the cards, so they looked for a different solution.
The one they found used short-range radios, with each user terminal sharing
the same upstream frequency to send frames to the central computer. It included a
simple and elegant method to solve the channel allocation problem. Their work
has been extended by many researchers since then (Schwartz and Abramson,
2009). Although Abramson’s work, called the ALOHA system, used ground-
based radio broadcasting, the basic idea is applicable to any system in which
uncoordinated users are competing for the use of a single shared channel.
We will discuss two versions of ALOHA here: pure and slotted. They differ
with respect to whether time is continuous, as in the pure version, or divided into
discrete slots into which all frames must fit.
Pure ALOHA
The basic idea of an ALOHA system is simple: let users transmit whenever
they have data to be sent. There will be collisions, of course, and the colliding
frames will be damaged. Senders need some way to find out if this is the case. In
the ALOHA system, after each station has sent its frame to the central computer,
this computer rebroadcasts the frame to all of the stations. A sending station can
thus listen for the broadcast from the hub to see if its frame has gotten through. In
other systems, such as wired LANs, the sender might be able to listen for collis-
ions while transmitting.
If the frame was destroyed, the sender just waits a random amount of time and
sends it again. The waiting time must be random or the same frames will collide
over and over, in lockstep. Systems in which multiple users share a common
channel in a way that can lead to conflicts are known as contention systems.
A sketch of frame generation in an ALOHA system is given in Fig. 4-1. We
have made the frames all the same length because the throughput of ALOHA sys-
tems is maximized by having a uniform frame size rather than by allowing vari-
able-length frames.
Whenever two frames try to occupy the channel at the same time, there will
be a collision (as seen in Fig. 4-1) and both will be garbled. If the first bit of a
new frame overlaps with just the last bit of a frame that has almost finished, both
frames will be totally destroyed (i.e., have incorrect checksums) and both will
have to be retransmitted later. The checksum does not (and should not) distin-
guish between a total loss and a near miss. Bad is bad.

Figure 4-1. In pure ALOHA, frames are transmitted at completely arbitrary times.
An interesting question is: what is the efficiency of an ALOHA channel? In
other words, what fraction of all transmitted frames escape collisions under these
chaotic circumstances? Let us first consider an infinite collection of users typing
at their terminals (stations). A user is always in one of two states: typing or wait-
ing. Initially, all users are in the typing state. When a line is finished, the user
stops typing, waiting for a response. The station then transmits a frame con-
taining the line over the shared channel to the central computer and checks the
channel to see if it was successful. If so, the user sees the reply and goes back to
typing. If not, the user continues to wait while the station retransmits the frame
over and over until it has been successfully sent.
Let the ‘‘frame time’’ denote the amount of time needed to transmit the stan-
dard, fixed-length frame (i.e., the frame length divided by the bit rate). At this
point, we assume that the new frames generated by the stations are well modeled
by a Poisson distribution with a mean of N frames per frame time. (The infinite-
population assumption is needed to ensure that N does not decrease as users be-
come blocked.) If N > 1, the user community is generating frames at a higher
rate than the channel can handle, and nearly every frame will suffer a collision.
For reasonable throughput, we would expect 0 < N < 1.
In addition to the new frames, the stations also generate retransmissions of
frames that previously suffered collisions. Let us further assume that the old and
new frames combined are well modeled by a Poisson distribution, with mean of G
frames per frame time. Clearly, G ≥N. At low load (i.e., N ∼∼0), there will be
few collisions, hence few retransmissions, so G ∼∼N. At high load, there will be
many collisions, so G > N. Under all loads, the throughput, S, is just the offered
load, G, times the probability, P 0, of a transmission succeeding—that is,
S = GP 0, where P 0 is the probability that a frame does not suffer a collision.
A frame will not suffer a collision if no other frames are sent within one
frame time of its start, as shown in Fig. 4-2. Under what conditions will the

shaded frame arrive undamaged? Let t be the time required to send one frame. If
any other user has generated a frame between time t 0 and t 0 + t, the end of that
frame will collide with the beginning of the shaded one. In fact, the shaded
frame’s fate was already sealed even before the first bit was sent, but since in pure
ALOHA a station does not listen to the channel before transmitting, it has no way
of knowing that another frame was already underway. Similarly, any other frame
started between t 0 + t and t 0 + 2t will bump into the end of the shaded frame.

The probability that k frames are generated during a given frame time, in
which G frames are expected, is given by the Poisson distribution
Pr[k ] =

so the probability of zero frames is just e −G. In an interval two frame times long,
the mean number of frames generated is 2G. The probability of no frames being
initiated during the entire vulnerable period is thus given by P 0 = e −2G. Using
S = GP 0, we get
S = Ge −2G
The relation between the offered traffic and the throughput is shown in
Fig. 4-3. The maximum throughput occurs at G = 0.5, with S = 1/2e, which is
about 0.184. In other words, the best we can hope for is a channel utilization of
18%. This result is not very encouraging, but with everyone transmitting at will,
we could hardly have expected a 100% success rate.
Slotted ALOHA
Soon after ALOHA came onto the scene, Roberts (1972) published a method
for doubling the capacity of an ALOHA system. His proposal was to divide time
into discrete intervals called slots, each interval corresponding to one frame. This

approach requires the users to agree on slot boundaries. One way to achieve syn-
chronization would be to have one special station emit a pip at the start of each in-
terval, like a clock.
In Roberts’ method, which has come to be known as slotted ALOHA—in
contrast to Abramson’s pure ALOHA—a station is not permitted to send when-
ever the user types a line. Instead, it is required to wait for the beginning of the
next slot. Thus, the continuous time ALOHA is turned into a discrete time one.
This halves the vulnerable period. To see this, look at Fig. 4-3 and imagine the
collisions that are now possible. The probability of no other traffic during the
same slot as our test frame is then e −G, which leads to
S = Ge −G
(4-3)
As you can see from Fig. 4-3, slotted ALOHA peaks at G = 1, with a throughput
of S = 1/e or about 0.368, twice that of pure ALOHA. If the system is operating
at G = 1, the probability of an empty slot is 0.368 (from Eq. 4-2). The best we
can hope for using slotted ALOHA is 37% of the slots empty, 37% successes, and
26% collisions. Operating at higher values of G reduces the number of empties
but increases the number of collisions exponentially. To see how this rapid
growth of collisions with G comes about, consider the transmission of a test
frame. The probability that it will avoid a collision is e −G, which is the probabil-
ity that all the other stations are silent in that slot. The probability of a collision is
then just 1 −e −G. The probability of a transmission requiring exactly k attempts
(i.e., k −1 collisions followed by one success) is
Pk = e −G(1 −e −G)k −1
The expected number of transmissions, E, per line typed at a terminal is then

As a result of the exponential dependence of E upon G, small increases in the
channel load can drastically reduce its performance.
Slotted ALOHA is notable for a reason that may not be initially obvious. It
was devised in the 1970s, used in a few early experimental systems, then almost
forgotten. When Internet access over the cable was invented, all of a sudden there
was a problem of how to allocate a shared channel among multiple competing
users. Slotted ALOHA was pulled out of the garbage can to save the day. Later,
having multiple RFID tags talk to the same RFID reader presented another varia-
tion on the same problem. Slotted ALOHA, with a dash of other ideas mixed in,
again came to the rescue. It has often happened that protocols that are perfectly
valid fall into disuse for political reasons (e.g., some big company wants everyone
to do things its way) or due to ever-changing technology trends. Then, years later
some clever person realizes that a long-discarded protocol solves his current prob-
lem. For this reason, in this chapter we will study a number of elegant protocols
that are not currently in widespread use but might easily be used in future applica-
tions, provided that enough network designers are aware of them. Of course, we
will also study many protocols that are in current use as well.
4.2.2 Carrier Sense Multiple Access Protocols
With slotted ALOHA, the best channel utilization that can be achieved is 1/e.
This low result is hardly surprising, since with stations transmitting at will, with-
out knowing what the other stations are doing there are bound to be many collis-
ions. In LANs, however, it is often possible for stations to detect what other sta-
tions are doing, and thus adapt their behavior accordingly. These networks can
achieve a much better utilization than 1/e. In this section, we will discuss some
protocols for improving performance.
Protocols in which stations listen for a carrier (i.e., a transmission) and act
accordingly are called carrier sense protocols. A number of them have been
proposed, and they were long ago analyzed in detail. For example, see Kleinrock
and Tobagi (1975). Below we will look at several versions of carrier sense proto-
cols.
Persistent and Nonpersistent CSMA
The first carrier sense protocol that we will study here is called 1-persistent
CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access). That is a bit of a mouthful for the sim-
plest CSMA scheme. When a station has data to send, it first listens to the chan-
nel to see if anyone else is transmitting at that moment. If the channel is idle, the
stations sends its data. Otherwise, if the channel is busy, the station just waits
until it becomes idle. Then the station transmits a frame. If a collision occurs, the

station waits a random amount of time and starts all over again. The protocol is
called 1-persistent because the station transmits with a probability of 1 when it
finds the channel idle.
You might expect that this scheme avoids collisions except for the rare case
of simultaneous sends, but it in fact it does not. If two stations become ready in
the middle of a third station’s transmission, both will wait politely until the trans-
mission ends, and then both will begin transmitting exactly simultaneously, re-
sulting in a collision. If they were not so impatient, there would be fewer collis-
ions.
More subtly, the propagation delay has an important effect on collisions.
There is a chance that just after a station begins sending, another station will be-
come ready to send and sense the channel. If the first station’s signal has not yet
reached the second one, the latter will sense an idle channel and will also begin
sending, resulting in a collision. This chance depends on the number of frames
that fit on the channel, or the bandwidth-delay product of the channel. If only a
tiny fraction of a frame fits on the channel, which is the case in most LANs since
the propagation delay is small, the chance of a collision happening is small. The
larger the bandwidth-delay product, the more important this effect becomes, and
the worse the performance of the protocol.
Even so, this protocol has better performance than pure ALOHA because both
stations have the decency to desist from interfering with the third station’s frame.
Exactly the same holds for slotted ALOHA.
A second carrier sense protocol is nonpersistent CSMA. In this protocol, a
conscious attempt is made to be less greedy than in the previous one. As before, a
station senses the channel when it wants to send a frame, and if no one else is
sending, the station begins doing so itself. However, if the channel is already in
use, the station does not continually sense it for the purpose of seizing it im-
mediately upon detecting the end of the previous transmission. Instead, it waits a
random period of time and then repeats the algorithm. Consequently, this algo-
rithm leads to better channel utilization but longer delays than 1-persistent
CSMA.
The last protocol is p-persistent CSMA. It applies to slotted channels and
works as follows. When a station becomes ready to send, it senses the channel. If
it is idle, it transmits with a probability p. With a probability q = 1 −p, it defers
until the next slot. If that slot is also idle, it either transmits or defers again, with
probabilities p and q. This process is repeated until either the frame has been
transmitted or another station has begun transmitting. In the latter case, the
unlucky station acts as if there had been a collision (i.e., it waits a random time
and starts again). If the station initially senses that the channel is busy, it waits
until the next slot and applies the above algorithm. IEEE 802.11 uses a refinement
of p-persistent CSMA that we will discuss in Sec. 4.4.
Figure 4-4 shows the computed throughput versus offered traffic for all three
protocols, as well as for pure and slotted ALOHA.

CSMA with Collision Detection
Persistent and nonpersistent CSMA protocols are definitely an improvement
over ALOHA because they ensure that no station begins to transmit while the
channel is busy. However, if two stations sense the channel to be idle and begin
transmitting simultaneously, their signals will still collide. Another improvement
is for the stations to quickly detect the collision and abruptly stop transmitting,
(rather than finishing them) since they are irretrievably garbled anyway. This
strategy saves time and bandwidth.
This protocol, known as CSMA/CD (CSMA with Collision Detection), is
the basis of the classic Ethernet LAN, so it is worth devoting some time to looking
at it in detail. It is important to realize that collision detection is an analog proc-
ess. The station’s hardware must listen to the channel while it is transmitting. If
the signal it reads back is different from the signal it is putting out, it knows that a
collision is occurring. The implications are that a received signal must not be tiny
compared to the transmitted signal (which is difficult for wireless, as received sig-
nals may be 1,000,000 times weaker than transmitted signals) and that the modu-
lation must be chosen to allow collisions to be detected (e.g., a collision of two 0-
volt signals may well be impossible to detect).
CSMA/CD, as well as many other LAN protocols, uses the conceptual model
of Fig. 4-5. At the point marked t 0, a station has finished transmitting its frame.
Any other station having a frame to send may now attempt to do so. If two or
more stations decide to transmit simultaneously, there will be a collision. If a sta-
tion detects a collision, it aborts its transmission, waits a random period of time,
and then tries again (assuming that no other station has started transmitting in the

meantime). Therefore, our model for CSMA/CD will consist of alternating con-
tention and transmission periods, with idle periods occurring when all stations are

Now let us look at the details of the contention algorithm. Suppose that two
stations both begin transmitting at exactly time t 0. How long will it take them to
realize that they have collided? The answer is vital to determining the length of
the contention period and hence what the delay and throughput will be.
The minimum time to detect the collision is just the time it takes the signal to
propagate from one station to the other. Based on this information, you might
think that a station that has not heard a collision for a time equal to the full cable
propagation time after starting its transmission can be sure it has seized the cable.
By ‘‘seized,’’ we mean that all other stations know it is transmitting and will not
interfere. This conclusion is wrong.
Consider the following worst-case scenario. Let the time for a signal to pro-
pagate between the two farthest stations be τ. At t 0, one station begins trans-
mitting. At t 0 + τ −ε, an instant before the signal arrives at the most distant sta-
tion, that station also begins transmitting. Of course, it detects the collision al-
most instantly and stops, but the little noise burst caused by the collision does not
get back to the original station until time 2τ −ε. In other words, in the worst case
a station cannot be sure that it has seized the channel until it has transmitted for 2τ
without hearing a collision.
With this understanding, we can think of CSMA/CD contention as a slotted
ALOHA system with a slot width of 2τ.
On a 1-km long coaxial cable,
τ ∼∼5 μsec. The difference for CSMA/CD compared to slotted ALOHA is that
slots in which only one station transmits (i.e., in which the channel is seized) are
followed by the rest of a frame. This difference will greatly improve performance
if the frame time is much longer than the propagation time.
4.2.3 Collision-Free Protocols
Although collisions do not occur with CSMA/CD once a station has unambi-
guously captured the channel, they can still occur during the contention period.
These collisions adversely affect the system performance, especially when the

bandwidth-delay product is large, such as when the cable is long (i.e., large τ) and
the frames are short. Not only do collisions reduce bandwidth, but they make the
time to send a frame variable, which is not a good fit for real-time traffic such as
voice over IP. CSMA/CD is also not universally applicable.
In this section, we will examine some protocols that resolve the contention for
the channel without any collisions at all, not even during the contention period.
Most of these protocols are not currently used in major systems, but in a rapidly
changing field, having some protocols with excellent properties available for fu-
ture systems is often a good thing.
In the protocols to be described, we assume that there are exactly N stations,
each programmed with a unique address from 0 to N −1. It does not matter that
some stations may be inactive part of the time. We also assume that propagation
delay is negligible. The basic question remains: which station gets the channel
after a successful transmission? We continue using the model of Fig. 4-5 with its
discrete contention slots.
A Bit-Map Protocol
In our first collision-free protocol, the basic bit-map method, each con-
tention period consists of exactly N slots. If station 0 has a frame to send, it trans-
mits a 1 bit during the slot 0. No other station is allowed to transmit during this
slot. Regardless of what station 0 does, station 1 gets the opportunity to transmit a
1 bit during slot 1, but only if it has a frame queued. In general, station j may
announce that it has a frame to send by inserting a 1 bit into slot j. After all N
slots have passed by, each station has complete knowledge of which stations wish
to transmit. At that point, they begin transmitting frames in numerical order (see
Fig. 4-6).

Since everyone agrees on who goes next, there will never be any collisions.
After the last ready station has transmitted its frame, an event all stations can easi-
ly monitor, another N-bit contention period is begun. If a station becomes ready
just after its bit slot has passed by, it is out of luck and must remain silent until
every station has had a chance and the bit map has come around again.

Protocols like this in which the desire to transmit is broadcast before the ac-
tual transmission are called reservation protocols because they reserve channel
ownership in advance and prevent collisions. Let us briefly analyze the perfor-
mance of this protocol. For convenience, we will measure time in units of the
contention bit slot, with data frames consisting of d time units.
Under conditions of low load, the bit map will simply be repeated over and
over, for lack of data frames. Consider the situation from the point of view of a
low-numbered station, such as 0 or 1. Typically, when it becomes ready to send,
the ‘‘current’’ slot will be somewhere in the middle of the bit map. On average,
the station will have to wait N /2 slots for the current scan to finish and another
full N slots for the following scan to run to completion before it may begin trans-
mitting.
The prospects for high-numbered stations are brighter. Generally, these will
only have to wait half a scan (N /2 bit slots) before starting to transmit. High-
numbered stations rarely have to wait for the next scan. Since low-numbered sta-
tions must wait on average 1.5N slots and high-numbered stations must wait on
average 0.5N slots, the mean for all stations is N slots.
The channel efficiency at low load is easy to compute. The overhead per
frame is N bits and the amount of data is d bits, for an efficiency of d /(d + N).
At high load, when all the stations have something to send all the time, the N-
bit contention period is prorated over N frames, yielding an overhead of only 1 bit
per frame, or an efficiency of d /(d + 1). The mean delay for a frame is equal to
the sum of the time it queues inside its station, plus an additional (N −1)d + N
once it gets to the head of its internal queue. This interval is how long it takes to
wait for all other stations to have their turn sending a frame and another bitmap.
Token Passing
The essence of the bit-map protocol is that it lets every station transmit a
frame in turn in a predefined order. Another way to accomplish the same thing is
to pass a small message called a token from one station to the next in the same
predefined order. The token represents permission to send. If a station has a
frame queued for transmission when it receives the token, it can send that frame
before it passes the token to the next station. If it has no queued frame, it simply
passes the token.
In a token ring protocol, the topology of the network is used to define the
order in which stations send. The stations are connected one to the next in a single
ring. Passing the token to the next station then simply consists of receiving the
token in from one direction and transmitting it out in the other direction, as seen in
Fig. 4-7. Frames are also transmitted in the direction of the token. This way they
will circulate around the ring and reach whichever station is the destination. How-
ever, to stop the frame circulating indefinitely (like the token), some station needs

to remove it from the ring. This station may be either the one that originally sent
the frame, after it has gone through a complete cycle, or the station that was the
intended recipient of the frame.

Figure 4-7. Token ring.
Note that we do not need a physical ring to implement token passing. The
channel connecting the stations might instead be a single long bus. Each station
then uses the bus to send the token to the next station in the predefined sequence.
Possession of the token allows a station to use the bus to send one frame, as be-
fore. This protocol is called token bus.
The performance of token passing is similar to that of the bit-map protocol,
though the contention slots and frames of one cycle are now intermingled. After
sending a frame, each station must wait for all N stations (including itself) to send
the token to their neighbors and the other N −1 stations to send a frame, if they
have one. A subtle difference is that, since all positions in the cycle are equiva-
lent, there is no bias for low- or high-numbered stations. For token ring, each sta-
tion is also sending the token only as far as its neighboring station before the pro-
tocol takes the next step. Each token does not need to propagate to all stations be-
fore the protocol advances to the next step.
Token rings have cropped up as MAC protocols with some consistency. An
early token ring protocol (called ‘‘Token Ring’’ and standardized as IEEE 802.5)
was popular in the 1980s as an alternative to classic Ethernet. In the 1990s, a
much faster token ring called FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) was
beaten out by switched Ethernet. In the 2000s, a token ring called RPR (Resi-
lient Packet Ring) was defined as IEEE 802.17 to standardize the mix of metro-
politan area rings in use by ISPs. We wonder what the 2010s will have to offer.
Binary Countdown
A problem with the basic bit-map protocol, and by extension token passing, is
that the overhead is 1 bit per station, so it does not scale well to networks with
thousands of stations. We can do better than that by using binary station ad-
dresses with a channel that combines transmissions. A station wanting to use the

channel now broadcasts its address as a binary bit string, starting with the high-
order bit. All addresses are assumed to be the same length. The bits in each ad-
dress position from different stations are BOOLEAN ORed together by the chan-
nel when they are sent at the same time. We will call this protocol binary count-
down. It was used in Datakit (Fraser, 1987). It implicitly assumes that the trans-
mission delays are negligible so that all stations see asserted bits essentially in-
stantaneously.
To avoid conflicts, an arbitration rule must be applied: as soon as a station
sees that a high-order bit position that is 0 in its address has been overwritten with
a 1, it gives up. For example, if stations 0010, 0100, 1001, and 1010 are all trying
to get the channel, in the first bit time the stations transmit 0, 0, 1, and 1, re-
spectively. These are ORed together to form a 1. Stations 0010 and 0100 see the
1 and know that a higher-numbered station is competing for the channel, so they
give up for the current round. Stations 1001 and 1010 continue.
The next bit is 0, and both stations continue. The next bit is 1, so station 1001
gives up. The winner is station 1010 because it has the highest address. After
winning the bidding, it may now transmit a frame, after which another bidding
cycle starts. The protocol is illustrated in Fig. 4-8. It has the property that high-
er-numbered stations have a higher priority than lower-numbered stations, which
may be either good or bad, depending on the context.

The channel efficiency of this method is d /(d + log2 N). If, however, the
frame format has been cleverly chosen so that the sender’s address is the first field
in the frame, even these log2 N bits are not wasted, and the efficiency is 100%.
Binary countdown is an example of a simple, elegant, and efficient protocol
that is waiting to be rediscovered. Hopefully, it will find a new home some day.

4.2.4 Limited-Contention Protocols
We have now considered two basic strategies for channel acquisition in a
broadcast network: contention, as in CSMA, and collision-free protocols. Each
strategy can be rated as to how well it does with respect to the two important per-
formance measures, delay at low load and channel efficiency at high load. Under
conditions of light load, contention (i.e., pure or slotted ALOHA) is preferable
due to its low delay (since collisions are rare). As the load increases, contention
becomes increasingly less attractive because the overhead associated with channel
arbitration becomes greater. Just the reverse is true for the collision-free proto-
cols. At low load, they have relatively high delay but as the load increases, the
channel efficiency improves (since the overheads are fixed).
Obviously, it would be nice if we could combine the best properties of the
contention and collision-free protocols, arriving at a new protocol that used con-
tention at low load to provide low delay, but used a collision-free technique at
high load to provide good channel efficiency. Such protocols, which we will call
limited-contention protocols, do in fact exist, and will conclude our study of car-
rier sense networks.
Up to now, the only contention protocols we have studied have been symmet-
ric. That is, each station attempts to acquire the channel with some probability, p,
with all stations using the same p. Interestingly enough, the overall system per-
formance can sometimes be improved by using a protocol that assigns different
probabilities to different stations.
Before looking at the asymmetric protocols, let us quickly review the per-
formance of the symmetric case. Suppose that k stations are contending for chan-
nel access.
Each has a probability p of transmitting during each slot.
The
probability that some station successfully acquires the channel during a given slot
is the probability that any one station transmits, with probability p, and all other
k −1 stations defer, each with probability 1 −p. This value is kp(1 −p)k −1. To
find the optimal value of p, we differentiate with respect to p, set the result to
zero, and solve for p. Doing so, we find that the best value of p is 1/k. Substitut-
ing p = 1/k, we get
Pr[success with optimal p] =
⎧
⎪
⎩
k
k −1 ⎫
⎪
⎭
k −1
(4-4)
This probability is plotted in Fig. 4-9. For small numbers of stations, the chances
of success are good, but as soon as the number of stations reaches even five, the
probability has dropped close to its asymptotic value of 1/e.
From Fig. 4-9, it is fairly obvious that the probability of some station acquir-
ing the channel can be increased only by decreasing the amount of competition.
The limited-contention protocols do precisely that. They first divide the stations
into (not necessarily disjoint) groups. Only the members of group 0 are permitted

to compete for slot 0. If one of them succeeds, it acquires the channel and trans-
mits its frame. If the slot lies fallow or if there is a collision, the members of
group 1 contend for slot 1, etc. By making an appropriate division of stations into
groups, the amount of contention for each slot can be reduced, thus operating each
slot near the left end of Fig. 4-9.
The trick is how to assign stations to slots. Before looking at the general case,
let us consider some special cases. At one extreme, each group has but one
member. Such an assignment guarantees that there will never be collisions be-
cause at most one station is contending for any given slot. We have seen such
protocols before (e.g., binary countdown). The next special case is to assign two
stations per group. The probability that both will try to transmit during a slot is
p 2, which for a small p is negligible. As more and more stations are assigned to
the same slot, the probability of a collision grows, but the length of the bit-map
scan needed to give everyone a chance shrinks. The limiting case is a single
group containing all stations (i.e., slotted ALOHA). What we need is a way to
assign stations to slots dynamically, with many stations per slot when the load is
low and few (or even just one) station per slot when the load is high.
The Adaptive Tree Walk Protocol
One particularly simple way of performing the necessary assignment is to use
the algorithm devised by the U.S. Army for testing soldiers for syphilis during
World War II (Dorfman, 1943). In short, the Army took a blood sample from N
soldiers. A portion of each sample was poured into a single test tube. This mixed
sample was then tested for antibodies. If none were found, all the soldiers in the
group were declared healthy. If antibodies were present, two new mixed samples

were prepared, one from soldiers 1 through N/2 and one from the rest. The proc-
ess was repeated recursively until the infected soldiers were determined.
For the computerized version of this algorithm (Capetanakis, 1979), it is con-
venient to think of the stations as the leaves of a binary tree, as illustrated in
Fig. 4-10. In the first contention slot following a successful frame transmission,
slot 0, all stations are permitted to try to acquire the channel. If one of them does
so, fine. If there is a collision, then during slot 1 only those stations falling under
node 2 in the tree may compete. If one of them acquires the channel, the slot fol-
lowing the frame is reserved for those stations under node 3. If, on the other
hand, two or more stations under node 2 want to transmit, there will be a collision
during slot 1, in which case it is node 4’s turn during slot 2.

Figure 4-10. The tree for eight stations.
In essence, if a collision occurs during slot 0, the entire tree is searched, depth
first, to locate all ready stations. Each bit slot is associated with some particular
node in the tree. If a collision occurs, the search continues recursively with the
node’s left and right children. If a bit slot is idle or if only one station transmits in
it, the searching of its node can stop because all ready stations have been located.
(Were there more than one, there would have been a collision.)
When the load on the system is heavy, it is hardly worth the effort to dedicate
slot 0 to node 1 because that makes sense only in the unlikely event that precisely
one station has a frame to send. Similarly, one could argue that nodes 2 and 3
should be skipped as well for the same reason. Put in more general terms, at what
level in the tree should the search begin? Clearly, the heavier the load, the farther
down the tree the search should begin. We will assume that each station has a
good estimate of the number of ready stations, q, for example, from monitoring
recent traffic.
To proceed, let us number the levels of the tree from the top, with node 1 in
Fig. 4-10 at level 0, nodes 2 and 3 at level 1, etc. Notice that each node at level i

---

## Page 21

277
has a fraction 2−i of the stations below it. If the q ready stations are uniformly
distributed, the expected number of them below a specific node at level i is just
2−iq. Intuitively, we would expect the optimal level to begin searching the tree to
be the one at which the mean number of contending stations per slot is 1, that is,
the level at which 2−iq = 1. Solving this equation, we find that i = log2 q.
Numerous improvements to the basic algorithm have been discovered and are
discussed in some detail by Bertsekas and Gallager (1992). For example, consid-
er the case of stations G and H being the only ones wanting to transmit. At node 1
a collision will occur, so 2 will be tried and discovered idle. It is pointless to
probe node 3 since it is guaranteed to have a collision (we know that two or more
stations under 1 are ready and none of them are under 2, so they must all be under
3). The probe of 3 can be skipped and 6 tried next. When this probe also turns up
nothing, 7 can be skipped and node G tried next.
4.2.5 Wireless LAN Protocols
A system of laptop computers that communicate by radio can be regarded as a
wireless LAN, as we discussed in Sec. 1.5.3. Such a LAN is an example of a
broadcast channel. It also has somewhat different properties than a wired LAN,
which leads to different MAC protocols. In this section, we will examine some of
these protocols. In Sec. 4.4, we will look at 802.11 (WiFi) in detail.
A common configuration for a wireless LAN is an office building with access
points (APs) strategically placed around the building. The APs are wired together
using copper or fiber and provide connectivity to the stations that talk to them. If
the transmission power of the APs and laptops is adjusted to have a range of tens
of meters, nearby rooms become like a single cell and the entire building becomes
like the cellular telephony systems we studied in Chap. 2, except that each cell
only has one channel. This channel is shared by all the stations in the cell, includ-
ing the AP. It typically provides megabit/sec bandwidths, up to 600 Mbps.
We have already remarked that wireless systems cannot normally detect a col-
lision while it is occurring. The received signal at a station may be tiny, perhaps a
million times fainter than the signal that is being transmitted. Finding it is like
looking for a ripple on the ocean. Instead, acknowledgements are used to dis-
cover collisions and other errors after the fact.
There is an even more important difference between wireless LANs and wired
LANs. A station on a wireless LAN may not be able to transmit frames to or re-
ceive frames from all other stations because of the limited radio range of the sta-
tions. In wired LANs, when one station sends a frame, all other stations receive
it. The absence of this property in wireless LANs causes a variety of complica-
tions.
We will make the simplifying assumption that each radio transmitter has some
fixed range, represented by a circular coverage region within which another sta-
tion can sense and receive the station’s transmission. It is important to realize that

---

## Page 22

278
THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER
CHAP. 4
in practice coverage regions are not nearly so regular because the propagation of
radio signals depends on the environment. Walls and other obstacles that attenu-
ate and reflect signals may cause the range to differ markedly in different direc-
tions. But a simple circular model will do for our purposes.
A naive approach to using a wireless LAN might be to try CSMA: just listen
for other transmissions and only transmit if no one else is doing so. The trouble
is, this protocol is not really a good way to think about wireless because what mat-
ters for reception is interference at the receiver, not at the sender. To see the na-
ture of the problem, consider Fig. 4-11, where four wireless stations are illustrat-
ed. For our purposes, it does not matter which are APs and which are laptops.
The radio range is such that A and B are within each other’s range and can poten-
tially interfere with one another. C can also potentially interfere with both B and
D, but not with A.

Figure 4-11. A wireless LAN. (a) A and C are hidden terminals when trans-
mitting to B. (b) B and C are exposed terminals when transmitting to A and D.
First consider what happens when A and C transmit to B, as depicted in
Fig. 4-11(a). If A sends and then C immediately senses the medium, it will not
hear A because A is out of range. Thus C will falsely conclude that it can transmit
to B. If C does start transmitting, it will interfere at B, wiping out the frame from
A. (We assume here that no CDMA-type scheme is used to provide multiple
channels, so collisions garble the signal and destroy both frames.) We want a
MAC protocol that will prevent this kind of collision from happening because it
wastes bandwidth. The problem of a station not being able to detect a potential
competitor for the medium because the competitor is too far away is called the
hidden terminal problem.
Now let us look at a different situation: B transmitting to A at the same time
that C wants to transmit to D, as shown in Fig. 4-11(b). If C senses the medium, it
will hear a transmission and falsely conclude that it may not send to D (shown as
a dashed line). In fact, such a transmission would cause bad reception only in the
zone between B and C, where neither of the intended receivers is located. We
want a MAC protocol that prevents this kind of deferral from happening because
it wastes bandwidth. The problem is called the exposed terminal problem.
The difficulty is that, before starting a transmission, a station really wants to
know whether there is radio activity around the receiver. CSMA merely tells it

---

## Page 23

SEC. 4.2
MULTIPLE ACCESS PROTOCOLS
279
whether there is activity near the transmitter by sensing the carrier. With a wire,
all signals propagate to all stations, so this distinction does not exist. However,
only one transmission can then take place at once anywhere in the system. In a
system based on short-range radio waves, multiple transmissions can occur simul-
taneously if they all have different destinations and these destinations are out of
range of one another. We want this concurrency to happen as the cell gets larger
and larger, in the same way that people at a party should not wait for everyone in
the room to go silent before they talk; multiple conversations can take place at
once in a large room as long as they are not directed to the same location.
An early and influential protocol that tackles these problems for wireless
LANs is MACA (Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) (Karn, 1990). The
basic idea behind it is for the sender to stimulate the receiver into outputting a
short frame, so stations nearby can detect this transmission and avoid transmitting
for the duration of the upcoming (large) data frame. This technique is used instead
of carrier sense.
MACA is illustrated in Fig. 4-12. Let us see how A sends a frame to B. A
starts by sending an RTS (Request To Send) frame to B, as shown in Fig. 4-12(a).
This short frame (30 bytes) contains the length of the data frame that will eventu-
ally follow. Then B replies with a CTS (Clear To Send) frame, as shown in
Fig. 4-12(b). The CTS frame contains the data length (copied from the RTS
frame). Upon receipt of the CTS frame, A begins transmission.

Now let us see how stations overhearing either of these frames react. Any
station hearing the RTS is clearly close to A and must remain silent long enough
for the CTS to be transmitted back to A without conflict. Any station hearing the
CTS is clearly close to B and must remain silent during the upcoming data trans-
mission, whose length it can tell by examining the CTS frame.

---

## Page 24

THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER
CHAP. 4
In Fig. 4-12, C is within range of A but not within range of B. Therefore, it
hears the RTS from A but not the CTS from B. As long as it does not interfere with
the CTS, it is free to transmit while the data frame is being sent. In contrast, D is
within range of B but not A. It does not hear the RTS but does hear the CTS.
Hearing the CTS tips it off that it is close to a station that is about to receive a
frame, so it defers sending anything until that frame is expected to be finished.
Station E hears both control messages and, like D, must be silent until the data
frame is complete.
Despite these precautions, collisions can still occur. For example, B and C
could both send RTS frames to A at the same time. These will collide and be lost.
In the event of a collision, an unsuccessful transmitter (i.e., one that does not hear
a CTS within the expected time interval) waits a random amount of time and tries
again later.
4.3 ETHERNET
We have now finished our discussion of channel allocation protocols in the
abstract, so it is time to see how these principles apply to real systems. Many of
the designs for personal, local, and metropolitan area networks have been stan-
dardized under the name of IEEE 802. A few have survived but many have not,
as we saw in Fig. 1-38. Some people who believe in reincarnation think that
Charles Darwin came back as a member of the IEEE Standards Association to
weed out the unfit. The most important of the survivors are 802.3 (Ethernet) and
802.11 (wireless LAN). Bluetooth (wireless PAN) is widely deployed but has now
been standardized outside of 802.15. With 802.16 (wireless MAN), it is too early
to tell. Please consult the 6th edition of this book to find out.
We will begin our study of real systems with Ethernet, probably the most ubi-
quitous kind of computer network in the world. Two kinds of Ethernet exist: clas-
sic Ethernet, which solves the multiple access problem using the techniques we
have studied in this chapter; and switched Ethernet, in which devices called
switches are used to connect different computers. It is important to note that,
while they are both referred to as Ethernet, they are quite different. Classic Ether-
net is the original form and ran at rates from 3 to 10 Mbps. Switched Ethernet is
what Ethernet has become and runs at 100, 1000, and 10,000 Mbps, in forms call-
ed fast Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet, and 10 gigabit Ethernet. In practice, only
switched Ethernet is used nowadays.
We will discuss these historical forms of Ethernet in chronological order
showing how they developed. Since Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 are identical except
for a minor difference (which we will discuss shortly), many people use the terms
‘‘Ethernet’’ and ‘‘IEEE 802.3’’ interchangeably. We will do so, too. For more
information about Ethernet, see Spurgeon (2000).

4.3.1 Classic Ethernet Physical Layer
The story of Ethernet starts about the same time as that of ALOHA, when a
student named Bob Metcalfe got his bachelor’s degree at M.I.T. and then moved
up the river to get his Ph.D. at Harvard. During his studies, he was exposed to
Abramson’s work. He became so interested in it that after graduating from Har-
vard, he decided to spend the summer in Hawaii working with Abramson before
starting work at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center). When he got to
PARC, he saw that the researchers there had designed and built what would later
be called personal computers. But the machines were isolated. Using his knowl-
edge of Abramson’s work, he, together with his colleague David Boggs, designed
and implemented the first local area network (Metcalfe and Boggs, 1976). It used
a single long, thick coaxial cable and ran at 3 Mbps.
They called the system Ethernet after the luminiferous ether, through which
electromagnetic radiation was once thought to propagate. (When the 19th-century
British physicist James Clerk Maxwell discovered that electromagnetic radiation
could be described by a wave equation, scientists assumed that space must be
filled with some ethereal medium in which the radiation was propagating. Only
after the famous Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 did physicists discover
that electromagnetic radiation could propagate in a vacuum.)
The Xerox Ethernet was so successful that DEC, Intel, and Xerox drew up a
standard in 1978 for a 10-Mbps Ethernet, called the DIX standard. With a minor
change, the DIX standard became the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983. Unfor-
tunately for Xerox, it already had a history of making seminal inventions (such as
the personal computer) and then failing to commercialize on them, a story told in
Fumbling the Future (Smith and Alexander, 1988). When Xerox showed little
interest in doing anything with Ethernet other than helping standardize it,
Metcalfe formed his own company, 3Com, to sell Ethernet adapters for PCs. It
sold many millions of them.
Classic Ethernet snaked around the building as a single long cable to which all
the computers were attached. This architecture is shown in Fig. 4-13. The first
variety, popularly called thick Ethernet, resembled a yellow garden hose, with
markings every 2.5 meters to show where to attach computers. (The 802.3 stan-
dard did not actually require the cable to be yellow, but it did suggest it.) It was
succeeded by thin Ethernet, which bent more easily and made connections using
industry-standard BNC connectors. Thin Ethernet was much cheaper and easier
to install, but it could run for only 185 meters per segment (instead of 500 m with
thick Ethernet), each of which could handle only 30 machines (instead of 100).
Each version of Ethernet has a maximum cable length per segment (i.e.,
unamplified length) over which the signal will propagate. To allow larger net-
works, multiple cables can be connected by repeaters. A repeater is a physical
layer device that receives, amplifies (i.e., regenerates), and retransmits signals in
both directions. As far as the software is concerned, a series of cable segments

connected by repeaters is no different from a single cable (except for a small
amount of delay introduced by the repeaters).
Over each of these cables, information was sent using the Manchester encod-
ing we studied in Sec. 2.5. An Ethernet could contain multiple cable segments and
multiple repeaters, but no two transceivers could be more than 2.5 km apart and
no path between any two transceivers could traverse more than four repeaters.
The reason for this restriction was so that the MAC protocol, which we will look
at next, would work correctly.
4.3.2 Classic Ethernet MAC Sublayer Protocol
The format used to send frames is shown in Fig. 4-14. First comes a Pream-
ble of 8 bytes, each containing the bit pattern 10101010 (with the exception of the
last byte, in which the last 2 bits are set to 11). This last byte is called the Start of
Frame delimiter for 802.3. The Manchester encoding of this pattern produces a
10-MHz square wave for 6.4 μsec to allow the receiver’s clock to synchronize
with the sender’s. The last two 1 bits tell the receiver that the rest of the frame is
about to start.

ordinary addresses and a 1 for group addresses. Group addresses allow multiple
stations to listen to a single address. When a frame is sent to a group address, all
the stations in the group receive it. Sending to a group of stations is called multi-
casting. The special address consisting of all 1 bits is reserved for broadcasting.
A frame containing all 1s in the destination field is accepted by all stations on the
network. Multicasting is more selective, but it involves group management to
define which stations are in the group. Conversely, broadcasting does not dif-
ferentiate between stations at all, so it does not require any group management.
An interesting feature of station source addresses is that they are globally
unique, assigned centrally by IEEE to ensure that no two stations anywhere in the
world have the same address. The idea is that any station can uniquely address
any other station by just giving the right 48-bit number. To do this, the first 3
bytes of the address field are used for an OUI (Organizationally Unique Identif-
ier). Values for this field are assigned by IEEE and indicate a manufacturer.
Manufacturers are assigned blocks of 224 addresses. The manufacturer assigns the
last 3 bytes of the address and programs the complete address into the NIC before
it is sold.
Next comes the Type or Length field, depending on whether the frame is Eth-
ernet or IEEE 802.3. Ethernet uses a Type field to tell the receiver what to do
with the frame. Multiple network-layer protocols may be in use at the same time
on the same machine, so when an Ethernet frame arrives, the operating system has
to know which one to hand the frame to. The Type field specifies which process
to give the frame to. For example, a type code of 0x0800 means that the data con-
tains an IPv4 packet.
IEEE 802.3, in its wisdom, decided that this field would carry the length of
the frame, since the Ethernet length was determined by looking inside the data—a
layering violation if ever there was one. Of course, this meant there was no way
for the receiver to figure out what to do with an incoming frame. That problem
was handled by the addition of another header for the LLC (Logical Link Con-
trol) protocol within the data. It uses 8 bytes to convey the 2 bytes of protocol
type information.
Unfortunately, by the time 802.3 was published, so much hardware and
software for DIX Ethernet was already in use that few manufacturers and users
were enthusiastic about repackaging the Type and Length fields. In 1997, IEEE
threw in the towel and said that both ways were fine with it. Fortunately, all the
Type fields in use before 1997 had values greater than 1500, then well established
as the maximum data size. Now the rule is that any number there less than or
equal to 0x600 (1536) can be interpreted as Length, and any number greater than
0x600 can be interpreted as Type. Now IEEE can maintain that everyone is using
its standard and everybody else can keep on doing what they were already doing
(not bothering with LLC) without feeling guilty about it.
Next come the data, up to 1500 bytes. This limit was chosen somewhat arbi-
trarily at the time the Ethernet standard was cast in stone, mostly based on the fact

that a transceiver needs enough RAM to hold an entire frame and RAM was
expensive in 1978. A larger upper limit would have meant more RAM, and hence
a more expensive transceiver.
In addition to there being a maximum frame length, there is also a minimum
frame length. While a data field of 0 bytes is sometimes useful, it causes a prob-
lem. When a transceiver detects a collision, it truncates the current frame, which
means that stray bits and pieces of frames appear on the cable all the time. To
make it easier to distinguish valid frames from garbage, Ethernet requires that
valid frames must be at least 64 bytes long, from destination address to checksum,
including both. If the data portion of a frame is less than 46 bytes, the Pad field is
used to fill out the frame to the minimum size.
Another (and more important) reason for having a minimum length frame is to
prevent a station from completing the transmission of a short frame before the
first bit has even reached the far end of the cable, where it may collide with
another frame. This problem is illustrated in Fig. 4-15. At time 0, station A, at
one end of the network, sends off a frame. Let us call the propagation time for
this frame to reach the other end τ. Just before the frame gets to the other end
(i.e., at time τ −ε), the most distant station, B, starts transmitting. When B detects
that it is receiving more power than it is putting out, it knows that a collision has
occurred, so it aborts its transmission and generates a 48-bit noise burst to warn
all other stations. In other words, it jams the ether to make sure the sender does
not miss the collision. At about time 2τ, the sender sees the noise burst and aborts
its transmission, too. It then waits a random time before trying again.

If a station tries to transmit a very short frame, it is conceivable that a colli-
sion will occur, but the transmission will have completed before the noise burst
gets back to the station at 2τ. The sender will then incorrectly conclude that the
frame was successfully sent. To prevent this situation from occurring, all frames
must take more than 2τ to send so that the transmission is still taking place when

the noise burst gets back to the sender. For a 10-Mbps LAN with a maximum
length of 2500 meters and four repeaters (from the 802.3 specification), the
round-trip time (including time to propagate through the four repeaters) has been
determined to be nearly 50 μsec in the worst case. Therefore, the shortest allowed
frame must take at least this long to transmit. At 10 Mbps, a bit takes 100 nsec, so
500 bits is the smallest frame that is guaranteed to work. To add some margin of
safety, this number was rounded up to 512 bits or 64 bytes.
The final field is the Checksum. It is a 32-bit CRC of the kind we studied in
Sec. 3.2. In fact, it is defined exactly by the generator polynomial we gave there,
which popped up for PPP, ADSL, and other links too. This CRC is an error-
detecting code that is used to determine if the bits of the frame have been received
correctly.
It just does error detection, with the frame dropped if an error is
detected.
CSMA/CD with Binary Exponential Backoff
Classic Ethernet uses the 1-persistent CSMA/CD algorithm that we studied in
Sec. 4.2. This descriptor just means that stations sense the medium when they
have a frame to send and send the frame as soon as the medium becomes idle.
They monitor the channel for collisions as they send. If there is a collision, they
abort the transmission with a short jam signal and retransmit after a random inter-
val.
Let us now see how the random interval is determined when a collision
occurs, as it is a new method. The model is still that of Fig. 4-5. After a collision,
time is divided into discrete slots whose length is equal to the worst-case round-
trip propagation time on the ether (2τ). To accommodate the longest path allowed
by Ethernet, the slot time has been set to 512 bit times, or 51.2 μsec.
After the first collision, each station waits either 0 or 1 slot times at random
before trying again. If two stations collide and each one picks the same random
number, they will collide again. After the second collision, each one picks either
0, 1, 2, or 3 at random and waits that number of slot times. If a third collision
occurs (the probability of this happening is 0.25), the next time the number of
slots to wait is chosen at random from the interval 0 to 23 −1.
In general, after i collisions, a random number between 0 and 2i −1 is chosen,
and that number of slots is skipped. However, after 10 collisions have been
reached, the randomization interval is frozen at a maximum of 1023 slots. After
16 collisions, the controller throws in the towel and reports failure back to the
computer. Further recovery is up to higher layers.
This algorithm, called binary exponential backoff, was chosen to dynami-
cally adapt to the number of stations trying to send. If the randomization interval
for all collisions were 1023, the chance of two stations colliding for a second time
would be negligible, but the average wait after a collision would be hundreds of
slot times, introducing significant delay. On the other hand, if each station always

delayed for either 0 or 1 slots, then if 100 stations ever tried to send at once they
would collide over and over until 99 of them picked 1 and the remaining station
picked 0. This might take years. By having the randomization interval grow ex-
ponentially as more and more consecutive collisions occur, the algorithm ensures
a low delay when only a few stations collide but also ensures that the collisions
are resolved in a reasonable interval when many stations collide. Truncating the
backoff at 1023 keeps the bound from growing too large.
If there is no collision, the sender assumes that the frame was probably suc-
cessfully delivered. That is, neither CSMA/CD nor Ethernet provides acknowl-
edgements. This choice is appropriate for wired and optical fiber channels that
have low error rates. Any errors that do occur must then be detected by the CRC
and recovered by higher layers. For wireless channels that have more errors, we
will see that acknowledgements are used.
4.3.3 Ethernet Performance
Now let us briefly examine the performance of classic Ethernet under condi-
tions of heavy and constant load, that is, with k stations always ready to transmit.
A rigorous analysis of the binary exponential backoff algorithm is complicated.
Instead, we will follow Metcalfe and Boggs (1976) and assume a constant
retransmission probability in each slot. If each station transmits during a conten-
tion slot with probability p, the probability A that some station acquires the chan-
nel in that slot is
A = kp(1 −p)k −1
(4-5)
A is maximized when p = 1/k, with A →1/e as k →∞. The probability that the
contention interval has exactly j slots in it is A(1 −A)j −1, so the mean number of
slots per contention is given by
j =0Σ
∞
jA(1 −A)j −1 = A
1
Since each slot has a duration 2τ, the mean contention interval, w, is 2τ/A.
Assuming optimal p, the mean number of contention slots is never more than e,
so w is at most 2τe ∼∼5.4τ.
If the mean frame takes P sec to transmit, when many stations have frames to
send,
Channel efficiency = P + 2τ/A
P
(4-6)
Here we see where the maximum cable distance between any two stations enters
into the performance figures. The longer the cable, the longer the contention
interval, which is why the Ethernet standard specifies a maximum cable length.

## Page 31

It is instructive to formulate Eq. (4-6) in terms of the frame length, F, the net-
work bandwidth, B, the cable length, L, and the speed of signal propagation, c,
for the optimal case of e contention slots per frame. With P = F/B, Eq. (4-6)
becomes
Channel efficiency = 1 + 2BLe /cF
1
(4-7)
When the second term in the denominator is large, network efficiency will be low.
More specifically, increasing network bandwidth or distance (the BL product)
reduces efficiency for a given frame size. Unfortunately, much research on net-
work hardware is aimed precisely at increasing this product. People want high
bandwidth over long distances (fiber optic MANs, for example), yet classic Ether-
net implemented in this manner is not the best system for these applications. We
will see other ways of implementing Ethernet in the next section.
In Fig. 4-16, the channel efficiency is plotted versus the number of ready sta-
tions for 2τ = 51.2 μsec and a data rate of 10 Mbps, using Eq. (4-7). With a 64-
byte slot time, it is not surprising that 64-byte frames are not efficient. On the
other hand, with 1024-byte frames and an asymptotic value of e 64-byte slots per
contention interval, the contention period is 174 bytes long and the efficiency is
85%. This result is much better than the 37% efficiency of slotted ALOHA.

It is probably worth mentioning that there has been a large amount of theoreti-
cal performance analysis of Ethernet (and other networks). Most of the results
should be taken with a grain (or better yet, a metric ton) of salt, for two reasons.

First, virtually all of the theoretical work assumes Poisson traffic. As researchers
have begun looking at real data, it now appears that network traffic is rarely Pois-
son. Instead, it is self-similar or bursty over a range of time scales (Paxson and
Floyd, 1995; and Leland et al., 1994). What this means is that averaging over
long periods of time does not smooth out the traffic. As well as using question-
able models, many of the analyses focus on the ‘‘interesting’’ performance cases
of abnormally high load. Boggs et al. (1988) showed by experimentation that Eth-
ernet works well in reality, even at moderately high load.
4.3.4 Switched Ethernet
Ethernet soon began to evolve away from the single long cable architecture of
classic Ethernet. The problems associated with finding breaks or loose connec-
tions drove it toward a different kind of wiring pattern, in which each station has a
dedicated cable running to a central hub. A hub simply connects all the attached
wires electrically, as if they were soldered together. This configuration is shown
in Fig. 4-17(a).

The wires were telephone company twisted pairs, since most office buildings
were already wired this way and normally plenty of spares were available. This
reuse was a win, but it did reduce the maximum cable run from the hub to 100
meters (200 meters if high quality Category 5 twisted pairs were used). Adding or
removing a station is simpler in this configuration, and cable breaks can be de-
tected easily. With the advantages of being able to use existing wiring and ease of
maintenance, twisted-pair hubs quickly became the dominant form of Ethernet.
However, hubs do not increase capacity because they are logically equivalent
to the single long cable of classic Ethernet. As more and more stations are added,
each station gets a decreasing share of the fixed capacity. Eventually, the LAN
will saturate. One way out is to go to a higher speed, say, from 10 Mbps to 100
Mbps, 1 Gbps, or even higher speeds. But with the growth of multimedia and
powerful servers, even a 1-Gbps Ethernet can become saturated.

Fortunately, there is an another way to deal with increased load: switched
Ethernet. The heart of this system is a switch containing a high-speed backplane
that connects all of the ports, as shown in Fig. 4-17(b). From the outside, a switch
looks just like a hub. They are both boxes, typically with 4 to 48 ports, each with
a standard RJ-45 connector for a twisted-pair cable. Each cable connects the
switch or hub to a single computer, as shown in Fig. 4-18. A switch has the same
advantages as a hub, too. It is easy to add or remove a new station by plugging or
unplugging a wire, and it is easy to find most faults since a flaky cable or port will
usually affect just one station. There is still a shared component that can fail—the
switch itself—but if all stations lose connectivity the IT folks know what to do to
fix the problem: replace the whole switch.

Figure 4-18. An Ethernet switch.
Inside the switch, however, something very different is happening. Switches
only output frames to the ports for which those frames are destined. When a
switch port receives an Ethernet frame from a station, the switch checks the Ether-
net addresses to see which port the frame is destined for. This step requires the
switch to be able to work out which ports correspond to which addresses, a pro-
cess that we will describe in Sec. 4.8 when we get to the general case of switches
connected to other switches. For now, just assume that the switch knows the
frame’s destination port. The switch then forwards the frame over its high-speed
backplane to the destination port. The backplane typically runs at many Gbps,
using a proprietary protocol that does not need to be standardized because it is
entirely hidden inside the switch. The destination port then transmits the frame on
the wire so that it reaches the intended station. None of the other ports even
knows the frame exists.
What happens if more than one of the stations or ports wants to send a frame
at the same time? Again, switches differ from hubs. In a hub, all stations are in
the same collision domain. They must use the CSMA/CD algorithm to schedule
their transmissions.
In a switch, each port is its own independent collision
domain. In the common case that the cable is full duplex, both the station and the
port can send a frame on the cable at the same time, without worrying about other
ports and stations. Collisions are now impossible and CSMA/CD is not needed.
However, if the cable is half duplex, the station and the port must contend for
transmission with CSMA/CD in the usual way.

A switch improves performance over a hub in two ways. First, since there are
no collisions, the capacity is used more efficiently. Second, and more impor-
tantly, with a switch multiple frames can be sent simultaneously (by different sta-
tions). These frames will reach the switch ports and travel over the switch’s back-
plane to be output on the proper ports. However, since two frames might be sent
to the same output port at the same time, the switch must have buffering so that it
can temporarily queue an input frame until it can be transmitted to the output port.
Overall, these improvements give a large performance win that is not possible
with a hub. The total system throughput can often be increased by an order of
magnitude, depending on the number of ports and traffic patterns.
The change in the ports on which frames are output also has security benefits.
Most LAN interfaces have a promiscuous mode, in which all frames are given to
each computer, not just those addressed to it. With a hub, every computer that is
attached can see the traffic sent between all of the other computers. Spies and
busybodies love this feature. With a switch, traffic is forwarded only to the ports
where it is destined. This restriction provides better isolation so that traffic will
not easily escape and fall into the wrong hands. However, it is better to encrypt
traffic if security is really needed.
Because the switch just expects standard Ethernet frames on each input port,
it is possible to use some of the ports as concentrators. In Fig. 4-18, the port in
the upper-right corner is connected not to a single station, but to a 12-port hub
instead. As frames arrive at the hub, they contend for the ether in the usual way,
including collisions and binary backoff. Successful frames make it through the
hub to the switch and are treated there like any other incoming frames. The
switch does not know they had to fight their way in. Once in the switch, they are
sent to the correct output line over the high-speed backplane. It is also possible
that the correct destination was one on the lines attached to the hub, in which case
the frame has already been delivered so the switch just drops it. Hubs are simpler
and cheaper than switches, but due to falling switch prices they have become an
endangered species. Modern networks largely use switched Ethernet. Neverthe-
less, legacy hubs still exist.
4.3.5 Fast Ethernet
At the same time that switches were becoming popular, the speed of 10-Mbps
Ethernet was coming under pressure. At first, 10 Mbps seemed like heaven, just
as cable modems seemed like heaven to the users of telephone modems. But the
novelty wore off quickly. As a kind of corollary to Parkinson’s Law (‘‘Work
expands to fill the time available for its completion’’), it seemed that data
expanded to fill the bandwidth available for their transmission.
Many installations needed more bandwidth and thus had numerous 10-Mbps
LANs connected by a maze of repeaters, hubs, and switches, although to the net-
work managers it sometimes felt that they were being held together by bubble

gum and chicken wire. But even with Ethernet switches, the maximum bandwidth
of a single computer was limited by the cable that connected it to the switch port.
It was in this environment that IEEE reconvened the 802.3 committee in 1992
with instructions to come up with a faster LAN. One proposal was to keep 802.3
exactly as it was, but just make it go faster. Another proposal was to redo it total-
ly and give it lots of new features, such as real-time traffic and digitized voice, but
just keep the old name (for marketing reasons). After some wrangling, the com-
mittee decided to keep 802.3 the way it was, and just make it go faster. This stra-
tegy would get the job done before the technology changed and avoid unforeseen
problems with a brand new design. The new design would also be backward-
compatible with existing Ethernet LANs. The people behind the losing proposal
did what any self-respecting computer-industry people would have done under
these circumstances: they stomped off and formed their own committee and stand-
ardized their LAN anyway (eventually as 802.12). It flopped miserably.
The work was done quickly (by standards committees’ norms), and the result,
802.3u, was approved by IEEE in June 1995. Technically, 802.3u is not a new
standard, but an addendum to the existing 802.3 standard (to emphasize its back-
ward compatibility). This strategy is used a lot. Since practically everyone calls
it fast Ethernet, rather than 802.3u, we will do that, too.
The basic idea behind fast Ethernet was simple: keep all the old frame for-
mats, interfaces, and procedural rules, but reduce the bit time from 100 nsec to 10
nsec. Technically, it would have been possible to copy 10-Mbps classic Ethernet
and still detect collisions on time by just reducing the maximum cable length by a
factor of 10. However, the advantages of twisted-pair wiring were so overwhelm-
ing that fast Ethernet is based entirely on this design. Thus, all fast Ethernet sys-
tems use hubs and switches; multidrop cables with vampire taps or BNC connec-
tors are not permitted.
Nevertheless, some choices still had to be made, the most important being
which wire types to support. One contender was Category 3 twisted pair. The
argument for it was that practically every office in the Western world had at least
four Category 3 (or better) twisted pairs running from it to a telephone wiring
closet within 100 meters.
Sometimes two such cables existed.
Thus, using
Category 3 twisted pair would make it possible to wire up desktop computers
using fast Ethernet without having to rewire the building, an enormous advantage
for many organizations.
The main disadvantage of a Category 3 twisted pair is its inability to carry
100 Mbps over 100 meters, the maximum computer-to-hub distance specified for
10-Mbps hubs. In contrast, Category 5 twisted pair wiring can handle 100 m
easily, and fiber can go much farther. The compromise chosen was to allow all
three possibilities, as shown in Fig. 4-19, but to pep up the Category 3 solution to
give it the additional carrying capacity needed.
The Category 3 UTP scheme, called 100Base-T4, used a signaling speed of
25 MHz, only 25% faster than standard Ethernet’s 20 MHz. (Remember that

Manchester encoding, discussed in Sec. 2.5, requires two clock periods for each
of the 10 million bits sent each second.) However, to achieve the necessary bit
rate, 100Base-T4 requires four twisted pairs. Of the four pairs, one is always to
the hub, one is always from the hub, and the other two are switchable to the
current transmission direction. To get 100 Mbps out of the three twisted pairs in
the transmission direction, a fairly involved scheme is used on each twisted pair.
It involves sending ternary digits with three different voltage levels. This scheme
is not likely to win any prizes for elegance, and we will skip the details. How-
ever, since standard telephone wiring for decades has had four twisted pairs per
cable, most offices are able to use the existing wiring plant. Of course, it means
giving up your office telephone, but that is surely a small price to pay for faster
email.
100Base-T4 fell by the wayside as many office buildings were rewired with
Category 5 UTP for 100Base-TX Ethernet, which came to dominate the market.
This design is simpler because the wires can handle clock rates of 125 MHz.
Only two twisted pairs per station are used, one to the hub and one from it. Nei-
ther straight binary coding (i.e., NRZ) nor Manchester coding is used. Instead, the
4B/5B encoding we described in Sec 2.5 is used. 4 data bits are encoded as 5 sig-
nal bits and sent at 125 MHz to provide 100 Mbps. This scheme is simple but has
sufficient transitions for synchronization and uses the bandwidth of the wire rela-
tively well. The 100Base-TX system is full duplex; stations can transmit at 100
Mbps on one twisted pair and receive at 100 Mbps on another twisted pair at the
same time.
The last option, 100Base-FX, uses two strands of multimode fiber, one for
each direction, so it, too, can run full duplex with 100 Mbps in each direction. In
this setup, the distance between a station and the switch can be up to 2 km.
Fast Ethernet allows interconnection by either hubs or switches. To ensure
that the CSMA/CD algorithm continues to work, the relationship between the
minimum frame size and maximum cable length must be maintained as the net-
work speed goes up from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps. So, either the minimum frame
size of 64 bytes must go up or the maximum cable length of 2500 m must come
down, proportionally. The easy choice was for the maximum distance between
any two stations to come down by a factor of 10, since a hub with 100-m cables
falls within this new maximum already. However, 2-km 100Base-FX cables are

too long to permit a 100-Mbps hub with the normal Ethernet collision algorithm.
These cables must instead be connected to a switch and operate in a full-duplex
mode so that there are no collisions.
Users quickly started to deploy fast Ethernet, but they were not about to throw
away 10-Mbps Ethernet cards on older computers. As a consequence, virtually all
fast Ethernet switches can handle a mix of 10-Mbps and 100-Mbps stations. To
make upgrading easy, the standard itself provides a mechanism called auto-
negotiation that lets two stations automatically negotiate the optimum speed (10
or 100 Mbps) and duplexity (half or full). It works well most of the time but is
known to lead to duplex mismatch problems when one end of the link autonego-
tiates but the other end does not and is set to full-duplex mode (Shalunov and
Carlson, 2005). Most Ethernet products use this feature to configure themselves.
4.3.6 Gigabit Ethernet
The ink was barely dry on the fast Ethernet standard when the 802 committee
began working on a yet faster Ethernet, quickly dubbed gigabit Ethernet. IEEE
ratified the most popular form as 802.3ab in 1999. Below we will discuss some of
the key features of gigabit Ethernet. More information is given by Spurgeon
(2000).
The committee’s goals for gigabit Ethernet were essentially the same as the
committee’s goals for fast Ethernet: increase performance tenfold while maintain-
ing compatibility with all existing Ethernet standards. In particular, gigabit Ether-
net had to offer unacknowledged datagram service with both unicast and broad-
cast, use the same 48-bit addressing scheme already in use, and maintain the same
frame format, including the minimum and maximum frame sizes. The final stan-
dard met all these goals.
Like fast Ethernet, all configurations of gigabit Ethernet use point-to-point
links. In the simplest configuration, illustrated in Fig. 4-20(a), two computers are
directly connected to each other. The more common case, however, uses a switch
or a hub connected to multiple computers and possibly additional switches or
hubs, as shown in Fig. 4-20(b). In both configurations, each individual Ethernet
cable has exactly two devices on it, no more and no fewer.
Also like fast Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet supports two different modes of
operation: full-duplex mode and half-duplex mode. The ‘‘normal’’ mode is full-
duplex mode, which allows traffic in both directions at the same time. This mode
is used when there is a central switch connected to computers (or other switches)
on the periphery. In this configuration, all lines are buffered so each computer
and switch is free to send frames whenever it wants to. The sender does not have
to sense the channel to see if anybody else is using it because contention is impos-
sible. On the line between a computer and a switch, the computer is the only pos-
sible sender to the switch, and the transmission will succeed even if the switch is
currently sending a frame to the computer (because the line is full duplex). Since

no contention is possible, the CSMA/CD protocol is not used, so the maximum
length of the cable is determined by signal strength issues rather than by how long
it takes for a noise burst to propagate back to the sender in the worst case.
Switch\%es are free to mix and match speeds. Autonegotiation is supported just
as in fast Ethernet, only now the choice is among 10, 100, and 1000 Mbps.
The other mode of operation, half-duplex, is used when the computers are
connected to a hub rather than a switch. A hub does not buffer incoming frames.
Instead, it electrically connects all the lines internally, simulating the multidrop
cable used in classic Ethernet. In this mode, collisions are possible, so the stan-
dard CSMA/CD protocol is required.
Because a 64-byte frame (the shortest
allowed) can now be transmitted 100 times faster than in classic Ethernet, the
maximum cable length must be 100 times less, or 25 meters, to maintain the
essential property that the sender is still transmitting when the noise burst gets
back to it, even in the worst case. With a 2500-meter-long cable, the sender of a
64-byte frame at 1 Gbps would be long finished before the frame got even a tenth
of the way to the other end, let alone to the end and back.
This length restriction was painful enough that two features were added to the
standard to increase the maximum cable length to 200 meters, which is probably
enough for most offices. The first feature, called carrier extension, essentially
tells the hardware to add its own padding after the normal frame to extend the
frame to 512 bytes. Since this padding is added by the sending hardware and
removed by the receiving hardware, the software is unaware of it, meaning that no
changes are needed to existing software. The downside is that using 512 bytes
worth of bandwidth to transmit 46 bytes of user data (the payload of a 64-byte
frame) has a line efficiency of only 9%.
The second feature, called frame bursting, allows a sender to transmit a con-
catenated sequence of multiple frames in a single transmission. If the total burst
is less than 512 bytes, the hardware pads it again. If enough frames are waiting
for transmission, this scheme is very efficient and preferred over carrier extension.

In all fairness, it is hard to imagine an organization buying modern computers
with gigabit Ethernet cards and then connecting them with an old-fashioned hub
to simulate classic Ethernet with all its collisions. Gigabit Ethernet interfaces and
switches used to be expensive, but their prices fell rapidly as sales volumes picked
up. Still, backward compatibility is sacred in the computer industry, so the com-
mittee was required to put it in. Today, most computers ship with an Ethernet
interface that is capable of 10-, 100-, and 1000-Mbps operation and compatible
with all of them.
Gigabit Ethernet supports both copper and fiber cabling, as listed in Fig. 4-21.
Signaling at or near 1 Gbps requires encoding and sending a bit every
nanosecond. This trick was initially accomplished with short, shielded copper
cables (the 1000Base-CX version) and optical fibers. For the optical fibers, two
wavelengths are permitted and result in two different versions: 0.85 microns
(short, for 1000Base-SX) and 1.3 microns (long, for 1000Base-LX).

Signaling at the short wavelength can be achieved with cheaper LEDs. It is
used with multimode fiber and is useful for connections within a building, as it
can run up to 500 m for 50-micron fiber. Signaling at the long wavelength
requires more expensive lasers. On the other hand, when combined with single-
mode (10-micron) fiber, the cable length can be up to 5 km. This limit allows long
distance connections between buildings, such as for a campus backbone, as a
dedicated point-to-point link. Later variations of the standard allowed even longer
links over single-mode fiber.
To send bits over these versions of gigabit Ethernet, the 8B/10B encoding we
described in Sec. 2.5 was borrowed from another networking technology called
Fibre Channel. That scheme encodes 8 bits of data into 10-bit codewords that are
sent over the wire or fiber, hence the name 8B/10B. The codewords were chosen
so that they could be balanced (i.e., have the same number of 0s and 1s) with suf-
ficient transitions for clock recovery. Sending the coded bits with NRZ requires a
signaling bandwidth of 25% more than that required for the uncoded bits, a big
improvement over the 100% expansion of Manchester coding.
However, all of these options required new copper or fiber cables to support
the faster signaling. None of them made use of the large amount of Category 5
UTP that had been installed along with fast Ethernet. Within a year, 1000Base-T

came along to fill this gap, and it has been the most popular form of gigabit Ether-
net ever since. People apparently dislike rewiring their buildings.
More complicated signaling is needed to make Ethernet run at 1000 Mbps
over Category 5 wires. To start, all four twisted pairs in the cable are used, and
each pair is used in both directions at the same time by using digital signal pro-
cessing to separate signals. Over each wire, five voltage levels that carry 2 bits
are used for signaling at 125 Msymbols/sec. The mapping to produce the symbols
from the bits is not straightforward. It involves scrambling, for transitions, fol-
lowed by an error correcting code in which four values are embedded into five
signal levels.
A speed of 1 Gbps is quite fast. For example, if a receiver is busy with some
other task for even 1 msec and does not empty the input buffer on some line, up to
1953 frames may have accumulated in that gap. Also, when a computer on a
gigabit Ethernet is shipping data down the line to a computer on a classic Ether-
net, buffer overruns are very likely. As a consequence of these two observations,
gigabit Ethernet supports flow control. The mechanism consists of one end send-
ing a special control frame to the other end telling it to pause for some period of
time. These PAUSE control frames are normal Ethernet frames containing a type
of 0x8808. Pauses are given in units of the minimum frame time. For gigabit
Ethernet, the time unit is 512 nsec, allowing for pauses as long as 33.6 msec.
There is one more extension that was introduced along with gigabit Ethernet.
Jumbo frames allow for frames to be longer than 1500 bytes, usually up to 9 KB.
This extension is proprietary. It is not recognized by the standard because if it is
used then Ethernet is no longer compatible with earlier versions, but most vendors
support it anyway. The rationale is that 1500 bytes is a short unit at gigabit
speeds. By manipulating larger blocks of information, the frame rate can be
decreased, along with the processing associated with it, such as interrupting the
processor to say that a frame has arrived, or splitting up and recombining mes-
sages that were too long to fit in one Ethernet frame.
4.3.7 10-Gigabit Ethernet
As soon as gigabit Ethernet was standardized, the 802 committee got bored
and wanted to get back to work. IEEE told them to start on 10-gigabit Ethernet.
This work followed much the same pattern as the previous Ethernet standards,
with standards for fiber and shielded copper cable appearing first in 2002 and
2004, followed by the standard for copper twisted pair in 2006.
10 Gbps is a truly prodigious speed, 1000x faster than the original Ethernet.
Where could it be needed? The answer is inside data centers and exchanges to
connect high-end routers, switches, and servers, as well as in long-distance, high
bandwidth trunks between offices that are enabling entire metropolitan area net-
works based on Ethernet and fiber. The long distance connections use optical
fiber, while the short connections may use copper or fiber.

All versions of 10-gigabit Ethernet support only full-duplex operation.
CSMA/CD is no longer part of the design, and the standards concentrate on the
details of physical layers that can run at very high speed. Compatibility still
matters, though, so 10-gigabit Ethernet interfaces autonegotiate and fall back to
the highest speed supported by both ends of the line.
The main kinds of 10-gigabit Ethernet are listed in Fig. 4-22. Multimode
fiber with the 0.85μ (short) wavelength is used for medium distances, and single-
mode fiber at 1.3μ (long) and 1.5μ (extended) is used for long distances.
10GBase-ER can run for distances of 40 km, making it suitable for wide area
applications. All of these versions send a serial stream of information that is pro-
duced by scrambling the data bits, then encoding them with a 64B/66B code. This
encoding has less overhead than an 8B/10B code.

The first copper version defined, 10GBase-CX4, uses a cable with four pairs
of twinaxial copper wiring. Each pair uses 8B/10B coding and runs at 3.125
Gsymbols/second to reach 10 Gbps. This version is cheaper than fiber and was
early to market, but it remains to be seen whether it will be beat out in the long
run by 10-gigabit Ethernet over more garden variety twisted pair wiring.
10GBase-T is the version that uses UTP cables. While it calls for Category 6a
wiring, for shorter runs, it can use lower categories (including Category 5) to
allow some reuse of installed cabling. Not surprisingly, the physical layer is quite
involved to reach 10 Gbps over twisted pair. We will only sketch some of the
high-level details. Each of the four twisted pairs is used to send 2500 Mbps in
both directions. This speed is reached using a signaling rate of 800 Msymbols/sec
with symbols that use 16 voltage levels. The symbols are produced by scrambling
the data, protecting it with a LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) code, and further
coding for error correction.
10-gigabit Ethernet is still shaking out in the market, but the 802.3 committee
has already moved on. At the end of 2007, IEEE created a group to standardize
Ethernet operating at 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps. This upgrade will let Ethernet com-
pete in very high-performance settings, including long-distance connections in
backbone networks and short connections over the equipment backplanes. The
standard is not yet complete, but proprietary products are already available.

4.3.8 Retrospective on Ethernet
Ethernet has been around for over 30 years and has no serious competitors in
sight, so it is likely to be around for many years to come. Few CPU architectures,
operating systems, or programming languages have been king of the mountain for
three decades going on strong. Clearly, Ethernet did something right. What?
Probably the main reason for its longevity is that Ethernet is simple and flexi-
ble. In practice, simple translates into reliable, cheap, and easy to maintain. Once
the hub and switch architecture was adopted, failures became extremely rare.
People hesitate to replace something that works perfectly all the time, especially
when they know that an awful lot of things in the computer industry work very
poorly, so that many so-called ‘‘upgrades’’ are worse than what they replaced.
Simple also translates into cheap. Twisted-pair wiring is relatively inexpen-
sive as are the hardware components. They may start out expensive when there is
a transition, for example, new gigabit Ethernet NICs or switches, but they are
merely additions to a well established network (not a replacement of it) and the
prices fall quickly as the sales volume picks up.
Ethernet is easy to maintain. There is no software to install (other than the
drivers) and not much in the way of configuration tables to manage (and get
wrong). Also, adding new hosts is as simple as just plugging them in.
Another point is that Ethernet interworks easily with TCP/IP, which has
become dominant. IP is a connectionless protocol, so it fits perfectly with Ether-
net, which is also connectionless. IP fits much less well with connection-oriented
alternatives such as ATM. This mismatch definitely hurt ATM’s chances.
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Ethernet has been able to evolve in cer-
tain crucial ways. Speeds have gone up by several orders of magnitude and hubs
and switches have been introduced, but these changes have not required changing
the software and have often allowed the existing cabling to be reused for a time.
When a network salesman shows up at a large installation and says ‘‘I have this
fantastic new network for you. All you have to do is throw out all your hardware
and rewrite all your software,’’ he has a problem.
Many alternative technologies that you have probably not even heard of were
faster than Ethernet when they were introduced. As well as ATM, this list
includes FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) and Fibre Channel,† two ring-
based optical LANs. Both were incompatible with Ethernet. Neither one made it.
They were too complicated, which led to complex chips and high prices. The les-
son that should have been learned here was KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid). Even-
tually, Ethernet caught up with them in terms of speed, often by borrowing some
of their technology, for example, the 4B/5B coding from FDDI and the 8B/10B
coding from Fibre Channel. Then they had no advantages left and quietly died off
or fell into specialized roles.
† It is called ‘‘Fibre Channel’’ and not ‘‘Fiber Channel’’ because the document editor was British.

It looks like Ethernet will continue to expand in its applications for some
time. 10-gigabit Ethernet has freed it from the distance constraints of CSMA/CD.
Much effort is being put into carrier-grade Ethernet to let network providers
offer Ethernet-based services to their customers for metropolitan and wide area
networks (Fouli and Maler, 2009). This application carries Ethernet frames long
distances over fiber and calls for better management features to help operators
offer reliable, high-quality services. Very high speed networks are also finding
uses in backplanes connecting components in large routers or servers. Both of
these uses are in addition to that of sending frames between computers in offices.
4.4 WIRELESS LANS
Wireless LANs are increasingly popular, and homes, offices, cafes, libraries,
airports, zoos, and other public places are being outfitted with them to connect
computers, PDAs, and smart phones to the Internet. Wireless LANs can also be
used to let two or more nearby computers communicate without using the Inter-
net.
The main wireless LAN standard is 802.11. We gave some background infor-
mation on it in Sec. 1.5.3. Now it is time to take a closer look at the technology.
In the following sections, we will look at the protocol stack, physical-layer radio
transmission techniques, the MAC sublayer protocol, the frame structure, and the
services provided. For more information about 802.11, see Gast (2005). To get
the truth from the mouth of the horse, consult the published standard, IEEE
802.11-2007 itself.
4.4.1 The 802.11 Architecture and Protocol Stack
802.11 networks can be used in two modes. The most popular mode is to con-
nect clients, such as laptops and smart phones, to another network, such as a com-
pany intranet or the Internet. This mode is shown in Fig. 4-23(a). In infrastructure
mode, each client is associated with an AP (Access Point) that is in turn con-
nected to the other network. The client sends and receives its packets via the AP.
Several access points may be connected together, typically by a wired network
called a distribution system, to form an extended 802.11 network. In this case,
clients can send frames to other clients via their APs.
The other mode, shown in Fig. 4-23(b), is an ad hoc network. This mode is a
collection of computers that are associated so that they can directly send frames to
each other. There is no access point. Since Internet access is the killer application
for wireless, ad hoc networks are not very popular.
Now we will look at the protocols. All the 802 protocols, including 802.11
and Ethernet, have a certain commonality of structure. A partial view of the
802.11 protocol stack is given in Fig. 4-24. The stack is the same for clients and

APs. The physical layer corresponds fairly well to the OSI physical layer, but the
data link layer in all the 802 protocols is split into two or more sublayers. In
802.11, the MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer determines how the channel
is allocated, that is, who gets to transmit next. Above it is the LLC (Logical Link
Control) sublayer, whose job it is to hide the differences between the different 802
variants and make them indistinguishable as far as the network layer is concerned.
This could have been a significant responsibility, but these days the LLC is a glue
layer that identifies the protocol (e.g., IP) that is carried within an 802.11 frame.

Several transmission techniques have been added to the physical layer as
802.11 has evolved since it first appeared in 1997. Two of the initial techniques,
infrared in the manner of television remote controls and frequency hopping in the
2.4-GHz band, are now defunct. The third initial technique, direct sequence
spread spectrum at 1 or 2 Mbps in the 2.4-GHz band, was extended to run at rates
up to 11 Mbps and quickly became a hit. It is now known as 802.11b.

To give wireless junkies a much-wanted speed boost, new transmission tech-
niques based on the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)
scheme we described in Sec. 2.5.3 were introduced in 1999 and 2003. The first is
called 802.11a and uses a different frequency band, 5 GHz. The second stuck with
2.4 GHz and compatibility. It is called 802.11g. Both give rates up to 54 Mbps.
Most recently, transmission techniques that simultaneously use multiple an-
tennas at the transmitter and receiver for a speed boost were finalized as 802.11n
in Oct. 2009. With four antennas and wider channels, the 802.11 standard now
defines rates up to a startling 600 Mbps.
We will now examine each of these transmission techniques briefly. We will
only cover those that are in use, however, skipping the legacy 802.11 transmission
methods. Technically, these belong to the physical layer and should have been
examined in Chap. 2, but since they are so closely tied to LANs in general and the
802.11 LAN in particular, we treat them here instead.
4.4.2 The 802.11 Physical Layer
Each of the transmission techniques makes it possible to send a MAC frame
over the air from one station to another. They differ, however, in the technology
used and speeds achievable. A detailed discussion of these technologies is far
beyond the scope of this book, but a few words on each one will relate the techni-
ques to the material we covered in Sec. 2.5 and will provide interested readers
with the key terms to search for elsewhere for more information.
All of the 802.11 techniques use short-range radios to transmit signals in ei-
ther the 2.4-GHz or the 5-GHz ISM frequency bands, both described in Sec. 2.3.3.
These bands have the advantage of being unlicensed and hence freely available to
any transmitter willing to meet some restrictions, such as radiated power of at
most 1 W (though 50 mW is more typical for wireless LAN radios). Unfortunate-
ly, this fact is also known to the manufacturers of garage door openers, cordless
phones, microwave ovens, and countless other devices, all of which compete with
laptops for the same spectrum. The 2.4-GHz band tends to be more crowded than
the 5-GHz band, so 5 GHz can be better for some applications even though it has
shorter range due to the higher frequency.
All of the transmission methods also define multiple rates. The idea is that
different rates can be used depending on the current conditions. If the wireless
signal is weak, a low rate can be used. If the signal is clear, the highest rate can be
used. This adjustment is called rate adaptation. Since the rates vary by a factor
of 10 or more, good rate adaptation is important for good performance. Of course,
since it is not needed for interoperability, the standards do not say how rate adap-
tation should be done.
The first transmission method we shall look at is 802.11b. It is a spread-spec-
trum method that supports rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps, though in practice the
operating rate is nearly always 11 Mbps. It is similar to the CDMA system we

examined in Sec. 2.5, except that there is only one spreading code that is shared
by all users. Spreading is used to satisfy the FCC requirement that power be
spread over the ISM band. The spreading sequence used by 201.11b is a Barker
sequence. It has the property that its autocorrelation is low except when the se-
quences are aligned. This property allows a receiver to lock onto the start of a
transmission. To send at a rate of 1 Mbps, the Barker sequence is used with
BPSK modulation to send 1 bit per 11 chips. The chips are transmitted at a rate of
11 Mchips/sec. To send at 2 Mbps, it is used with QPSK modulation to send 2
bits per 11 chips. The higher rates are different. These rates use a technique call-
ed CCK (Complementary Code Keying) to construct codes instead of the
Barker sequence. The 5.5-Mbps rate sends 4 bits in every 8-chip code, and the
11-Mbps rate sends 8 bits in every 8-chip code.
Next we come to 802.11a, which supports rates up to 54 Mbps in the 5-GHz
ISM band. You might have expected that 802.11a to come before 802.11b, but
that was not the case. Although the 802.11a group was set up first, the 802.11b
standard was approved first and its product got to market well ahead of the
802.11a products, partly because of the difficulty of operating in the higher 5-GHz
band.
The 802.11a method is based on OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing) because OFDM uses the spectrum efficiently and resists wireless
signal degradations such as multipath. Bits are sent over 52 subcarriers in paral-
lel, 48 carrying data and 4 used for synchronization. Each symbol lasts 4μs and
sends 1, 2, 4, or 6 bits. The bits are coded for error correction with a binary con-
volutional code first, so only 1/2, 2/3, or 3/4 of the bits are not redundant. With
different combinations, 802.11a can run at eight different rates, ranging from 6 to
54 Mbps. These rates are significantly faster than 802.11b rates, and there is less
interference in the 5-GHz band. However, 802.11b has a range that is about seven
times greater than that of 802.11a, which is more important in many situations.
Even with the greater range, the 802.11b people had no intention of letting
this upstart win the speed championship. Fortunately, in May 2002, the FCC
dropped its long-standing rule requiring all wireless communications equipment
operating in the ISM bands in the U.S. to use spread spectrum, so it got to work
on 802.11g, which was approved by IEEE in 2003. It copies the OFDM modula-
tion methods of 802.11a but operates in the narrow 2.4-GHz ISM band along with
802.11b. It offers the same rates as 802.11a (6 to 54 Mbps) plus of course compa-
tibility with any 802.11b devices that happen to be nearby. All of these different
choices can be confusing for customers, so it is common for products to support
802.11a/b/g in a single NIC.
Not content to stop there, the IEEE committee began work on a high-through-
put physical layer called 802.11n. It was ratified in 2009. The goal for 802.11n
was throughput of at least 100 Mbps after all the wireless overheads were re-
moved. This goal called for a raw speed increase of at least a factor of four. To
make it happen, the committee doubled the channels from 20 MHz to 40 MHz and

reduced framing overheads by allowing a group of frames to be sent together.
More significantly, however, 802.11n uses up to four antennas to transmit up to
four streams of information at the same time. The signals of the streams interfere
at the receiver, but they can be separated using MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple
Output) communications techniques. The use of multiple antennas gives a large
speed boost, or better range and reliability instead. MIMO, like OFDM, is one of
those clever communications ideas that is changing wireless designs and which
we are all likely to hear a lot about in the future. For a brief introduction to multi-
ple antennas in 802.11 see Halperin et al. (2010).
4.4.3 The 802.11 MAC Sublayer Protocol
Let us now return from the land of electrical engineering to the land of com-
puter science. The 802.11 MAC sublayer protocol is quite different from that of
Ethernet, due to two factors that are fundamental to wireless communication.
First, radios are nearly always half duplex, meaning that they cannot transmit
and listen for noise bursts at the same time on a single frequency. The received
signal can easily be a million times weaker than the transmitted signal, so it can-
not be heard at the same time. With Ethernet, a station just waits until the ether
goes silent and then starts transmitting. If it does not receive a noise burst back
while transmitting the first 64 bytes, the frame has almost assuredly been deliv-
ered correctly. With wireless, this collision detection mechanism does not work.
Instead, 802.11 tries to avoid collisions with a protocol called CSMA/CA
(CSMA with Collision Avoidance). This protocol is conceptually similar to
Ethernet’s CSMA/CD, with channel sensing before sending and exponential back
off after collisions. However, a station that has a frame to send starts with a ran-
dom backoff (except in the case that it has not used the channel recently and the
channel is idle). It does not wait for a collision. The number of slots to backoff is
chosen in the range 0 to, say, 15 in the case of the OFDM physical layer. The sta-
tion waits until the channel is idle, by sensing that there is no signal for a short
period of time (called the DIFS, as we explain below), and counts down idle slots,
pausing when frames are sent. It sends its frame when the counter reaches 0. If
the frame gets through, the destination immediately sends a short acknowledge-
ment. Lack of an acknowledgement is inferred to indicate an error, whether a col-
lision or otherwise. In this case, the sender doubles the backoff period and tries
again, continuing with exponential backoff as in Ethernet until the frame has been
successfully transmitted or the maximum number of retransmissions has been
reached.
An example timeline is shown in Fig. 4-25. Station A is the first to send a
frame. While A is sending, stations B and C become ready to send. They see that
the channel is busy and wait for it to become idle. Shortly after A receives an ac-
knowledgement, the channel goes idle. However, rather than sending a frame
right away and colliding, B and C both perform a backoff. C picks a short backoff,

and thus sends first. B pauses its countdown while it senses that C is using the
channel, and resumes after C has received an acknowledgement. B soon com-
pletes its backoff and sends its frame.

Compared to Ethernet, there are two main differences. First, starting backoffs
early helps to avoid collisions. This avoidance is worthwhile because collisions
are expensive, as the entire frame is transmitted even if one occurs. Second, ac-
knowledgements are used to infer collisions because collisions cannot be detected.
This mode of operation is called DCF (Distributed Coordination Function)
because each station acts independently, without any kind of central control. The
standard also includes an optional mode of operation called PCF (Point Coordi-
nation Function) in which the access point controls all activity in its cell, just
like a cellular base station. However, PCF is not used in practice because there is
normally no way to prevent stations in another nearby network from transmitting
competing traffic.
The second problem is that the transmission ranges of different stations may
be different. With a wire, the system is engineered so that all stations can hear
each other. With the complexities of RF propagation this situation does not hold
for wireless stations. Consequently, situations such as the hidden terminal prob-
lem mentioned earlier and illustrated again in Fig. 4-26(a) can arise. Since not all
stations are within radio range of each other, transmissions going on in one part of
a cell may not be received elsewhere in the same cell. In this example, station C
is transmitting to station B. If A senses the channel, it will not hear anything and
will falsely conclude that it may now start transmitting to B. This decision leads
to a collision.
The inverse situation is the exposed terminal problem, illustrated in Fig. 4-
26(b). Here, B wants to send to C, so it listens to the channel. When it hears a

transmission, it falsely concludes that it may not send to C, even though A may in
fact be transmitting to D (not shown). This decision wastes a transmission oppor-
tunity.
To reduce ambiguities about which station is sending, 802.11 defines channel
sensing to consist of both physical sensing and virtual sensing. Physical sensing
simply checks the medium to see if there is a valid signal. With virtual sensing,
each station keeps a logical record of when the channel is in use by tracking the
NAV (Network Allocation Vector). Each frame carries a NAV field that says
how long the sequence of which this frame is part will take to complete. Stations
that overhear this frame know that the channel will be busy for the period indi-
cated by the NAV, regardless of whether they can sense a physical signal. For ex-
ample, the NAV of a data frame includes the time needed to send an acknowledge-
ment. All stations that hear the data frame will defer during the acknowledgement
period, whether or not they can hear the acknowledgement.
An optional RTS/CTS mechanism uses the NAV to prevent terminals from
sending frames at the same time as hidden terminals. It is shown in Fig. 4-27. In
this example, A wants to send to B. C is a station within range of A (and possibly
within range of B, but that does not matter). D is a station within range of B but
not within range of A.
The protocol starts when A decides it wants to send data to B. A begins by
sending an RTS frame to B to request permission to send it a frame. If B receives
this request, it answers with a CTS frame to indicate that the channel is clear to
send. Upon receipt of the CTS, A sends its frame and starts an ACK timer. Upon
correct receipt of the data frame, B responds with an ACK frame, completing the
exchange. If A’s ACK timer expires before the ACK gets back to it, it is treated as
a collision and the whole protocol is run again after a backoff.

Now let us consider this exchange from the viewpoints of C and D. C is with-
in range of A, so it may receive the RTS frame. If it does, it realizes that someone
is going to send data soon. From the information provided in the RTS request, it
can estimate how long the sequence will take, including the final ACK. So, for the
good of all, it desists from transmitting anything until the exchange is completed.
It does so by updating its record of the NAV to indicate that the channel is busy, as
shown in Fig. 4-27. D does not hear the RTS, but it does hear the CTS, so it also
updates its NAV. Note that the NAV signals are not transmitted; they are just in-
ternal reminders to keep quiet for a certain period of time.
However, while RTS/CTS sounds good in theory, it is one of those designs that
has proved to be of little value in practice. Several reasons why it is seldom used
are known. It does not help for short frames (which are sent in place of the RTS)
or for the AP (which everyone can hear, by definition). For other situations, it
only slows down operation. RTS/CTS in 802.11 is a little different than in the
MACA protocol we saw in Sec 4.2 because everyone hearing the RTS or CTS
remains quiet for the duration to allow the ACK to get through without collision.
Because of this, it does not help with exposed terminals as MACA did, only with
hidden terminals. Most often there are few hidden terminals, and CSMA/CA al-
ready helps them by slowing down stations that transmit unsuccessfully, whatever
the cause, to make it more likely that transmissions will succeed.
CSMA/CA with physical and virtual sensing is the core of the 802.11 proto-
col. However, there are several other mechanisms that have been developed to go
with it. Each of these mechanisms was driven by the needs of real operation, so
we will look at them briefly.
The first need we will look at is reliability. In contrast to wired networks,
wireless networks are noisy and unreliable, in no small part due to interference
from other kinds of devices, such as microwave ovens, which also use the unli-
censed ISM bands. The use of acknowledgements and retransmissions is of little
help if the probability of getting a frame through is small in the first place.

The main strategy that is used to increase successful transmissions is to lower
the transmission rate. Slower rates use more robust modulations that are more
likely to be received correctly for a given signal-to-noise ratio. If too many
frames are lost, a station can lower the rate. If frames are delivered with little
loss, a station can occasionally test a higher rate to see if it should be used.
Another strategy to improve the chance of the frame getting through undam-
aged is to send shorter frames. If the probability of any bit being in error is p, the
probability of an n-bit frame being received entirely correctly is (1 −p)n. For ex-
ample, for p = 10−4, the probability of receiving a full Ethernet frame (12,144
bits) correctly is less than 30%. Most frames will be lost. But if the frames are
only a third as long (4048 bits) two thirds of them will be received correctly. Now
most frames will get through and fewer retransmissions will be needed.
Shorter frames can be implemented by reducing the maximum size of the
message that is accepted from the network layer. Alternatively, 802.11 allows
frames to be split into smaller pieces, called fragments, each with its own check-
sum. The fragment size is not fixed by the standard, but is a parameter that can be
adjusted by the AP. The fragments are individually numbered and acknowledged
using a stop-and-wait protocol (i.e., the sender may not transmit fragment k + 1
until it has received the acknowledgement for fragment k). Once the channel has
been acquired, multiple fragments are sent as a burst. They go one after the other
with an acknowledgement (and possibly retransmissions) in between, until either
the whole frame has been successfully sent or the transmission time reaches the
maximum allowed. The NAV mechanism keeps other stations quiet only until the
next acknowledgement, but another mechanism (see below) is used to allow a
burst of fragments to be sent without other stations sending a frame in the middle.
The second need we will discuss is saving power. Battery life is always an
issue with mobile wireless devices. The 802.11 standard pays attention to the
issue of power management so that clients need not waste power when they have
neither information to send nor to receive.
The basic mechanism for saving power builds on beacon frames. Beacons
are periodic broadcasts by the AP (e.g., every 100 msec). The frames advertise
the presence of the AP to clients and carry system parameters, such as the identi-
fier of the AP, the time, how long until the next beacon, and security settings.
Clients can set a power-management bit in frames that they send to the AP to
tell it that they are entering power-save mode. In this mode, the client can doze
and the AP will buffer traffic intended for it. To check for incoming traffic, the
client wakes up for every beacon, and checks a traffic map that is sent as part of
the beacon. This map tells the client if there is buffered traffic. If so, the client
sends a poll message to the AP, which then sends the buffered traffic. The client
can then go back to sleep until the next beacon is sent.
Another power-saving mechanism, called APSD (Automatic Power Save
Delivery), was also added to 802.11 in 2005. With this new mechanism, the AP
buffers frames and sends them to a client just after the client sends frames to the

---

THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER

AP. The client can then go to sleep until it has more traffic to send (and receive).
This mechanism works well for applications such as VoIP that have frequent traf-
fic in both directions. For example, a VoIP wireless phone might use it to send
and receive frames every 20 msec, much more frequently than the beacon interval
of 100 msec, while dozing in between.
The third and last need we will examine is quality of service. When the VoIP
traffic in the preceding example competes with peer-to-peer traffic, the VoIP traf-
fic will suffer. It will be delayed due to contention with the high-bandwidth
peer-to-peer traffic, even though the VoIP bandwidth is low. These delays are
likely to degrade the voice calls. To prevent this degradation, we would like to let
the VoIP traffic go ahead of the peer-to-peer traffic, as it is of higher priority.
IEEE 802.11 has a clever mechanism to provide this kind of quality of service
that was introduced as set of extensions under the name 802.11e in 2005. It works
by extending CSMA/CA with carefully defined intervals between frames. After a
frame has been sent, a certain amount of idle time is required before any station
may send a frame to check that the channel is no longer in use. The trick is to
define different time intervals for different kinds of frames.
Five intervals are depicted in Fig. 4-28. The interval between regular data
frames is called the DIFS (DCF InterFrame Spacing). Any station may attempt
to acquire the channel to send a new frame after the medium has been idle for
DIFS. The usual contention rules apply, and binary exponential backoff may be
needed if a collision occurs. The shortest interval is SIFS (Short InterFrame
Spacing). It is used to allow the parties in a single dialog the chance to go first.
Examples include letting the receiver send an ACK, other control frame sequences
like RTS and CTS, or letting a sender transmit a burst of fragments. Sending the
next fragment after waiting only SIFS is what prevents another station from jump-
ing in with a frame in the middle of the exchange.

The two AIFS (Arbitration InterFrame Space) intervals show examples of
two different priority levels. The short interval, AIFS1, is smaller than DIFS but
longer than SIFS. It can be used by the AP to move voice or other high-priority

traffic to the head of the line. The AP will wait for a shorter interval before it
sends the voice traffic, and thus send it before regular traffic. The long interval,
AIFS4, is larger than DIFS. It is used for background traffic that can be deferred
until after regular traffic. The AP will wait for a longer interval before it sends
this traffic, giving regular traffic the opportunity to transmit first. The complete
quality of service mechanism defines four different priority levels that have dif-
ferent backoff parameters as well as different idle parameters.
The last time interval, EIFS (Extended InterFrame Spacing), is used only
by a station that has just received a bad or unknown frame, to report the problem.
The idea is that since the receiver may have no idea of what is going on, it should
wait a while to avoid interfering with an ongoing dialog between two stations.
A further part of the quality of service extensions is the notion of a TXOP or
transmission opportunity. The original CSMA/CA mechanism let stations send
one frame at a time. This design was fine until the range of rates increased. With
802.11a/g, one station might be sending at 6 Mbps and another station be sending
at 54 Mbps. They each get to send one frame, but the 6-Mbps station takes nine
times as long (ignoring fixed overheads) as the 54-Mbps station to send its frame.
This disparity has the unfortunate side effect of slowing down a fast sender who is
competing with a slow sender to roughly the rate of the slow sender. For example,
again ignoring fixed overheads, when sending alone the 6-Mbps and 54-Mbps
senders will get their own rates, but when sending together they will both get 5.4
Mbps on average. It is a stiff penalty for the fast sender. This issue is known as
the rate anomaly (Heusse et al., 2003).
With transmission opportunities, each station gets an equal amount of airtime,
not an equal number of frames. Stations that send at a higher rate for their airtime
will get higher throughput. In our example, when sending together the 6-Mbps and
54-Mbps senders will now get 3 Mbps and 27 Mbps, respectively.
4.4.4 The 802.11 Frame Structure
The 802.11 standard defines three different classes of frames in the air: data,
control, and management. Each of these has a header with a variety of fields used
within the MAC sublayer. In addition, there are some headers used by the physi-
cal layer, but these mostly deal with the modulation techniques used, so we will
not discuss them here.
We will look at the format of the data frame as an example. It is shown in
Fig. 4-29. First comes the Frame control field, which is made up of 11 subfields.
The first of these is the Protocol version, set to 00. It is there to allow future ver-
sions of 802.11 to operate at the same time in the same cell. Then come the Type
(data, control, or management) and Subtype fields (e.g., RTS or CTS). For a regu-
lar data frame (without quality of service), they are set to 10 and 0000 in binary.
The To DS and From DS bits are set to indicate whether the frame is going to or
coming from the network connected to the APs, which is called the distribution

system. The More fragments bit means that more fragments will follow. The
Retry bit marks a retransmission of a frame sent earlier. The Power management
bit indicates that the sender is going into power-save mode. The More data bit in-
dicates that the sender has additional frames for the receiver. The Protected
Frame bit indicates that the frame body has been encrypted for security. We will
discuss security briefly in the next section. Finally, the Order bit tells the receiver
that the higher layer expects the sequence of frames to arrive strictly in order.

The second field of the data frame, the Duration field, tells how long the
frame and its acknowledgement will occupy the channel, measured in microsec-
onds. It is present in all types of frames, including control frames, and is what
stations use to manage the NAV mechanism.
Next come addresses. Data frames sent to or from an AP have three ad-
dresses, all in standard IEEE 802 format. The first address is the receiver, and the
second address is the transmitter. They are obviously needed, but what is the third
address for? Remember that the AP is simply a relay point for frames as they
travel between a client and another point on the network, perhaps a distant client
or a portal to the Internet. The third address gives this distant endpoint.
The Sequence field numbers frames so that duplicates can be detected. Of the
16 bits available, 4 identify the fragment and 12 carry a number that is advanced
with each new transmission. The Data field contains the payload, up to 2312
bytes. The first bytes of this payload are in a format known as LLC (Logical
Link Control). This layer is the glue that identifies the higher-layer protocol
(e.g., IP) to which the payloads should be passed. Last comes the Frame check
sequence, which is the same 32-bit CRC we saw in Sec. 3.2.2 and elsewhere.
Management frames have the same format as data frames, plus a format for
the data portion that varies with the subtype (e.g., parameters in beacon frames).
Control frames are short. Like all frames, they have the Frame control, Duration,
and Frame check sequence fields. However, they may have only one address and
no data portion. Most of the key information is conveyed with the Subtype field
(e.g., ACK, RTS and CTS).

4.4.5 Services
The 802.11 standard defines the services that the clients, the access points,
and the network connecting them must be a conformant wireless LAN. These ser-
vices cluster into several groups.
The association service is used by mobile stations to connect themselves to
APs. Typically, it is used just after a station moves within radio range of the AP.
Upon arrival, the station learns the identity and capabilities of the AP, either from
beacon frames or by directly asking the AP. The capabilities include the data rates
supported, security arrangements, power-saving capabilities, quality of service
support, and more. The station sends a request to associate with the AP. The AP
may accept or reject the request.
Reassociation lets a station change its preferred AP. This facility is useful
for mobile stations moving from one AP to another AP in the same extended
802.11 LAN, like a handover in the cellular network. If it is used correctly, no
data will be lost as a consequence of the handover. (But 802.11, like Ethernet, is
just a best-effort service.) Either the station or the AP may also disassociate,
breaking their relationship. A station should use this service before shutting down
or leaving the network. The AP may use it before going down for maintenance.
Stations must also authenticate before they can send frames via the AP, but
authentication is handled in different ways depending on the choice of security
scheme. If the 802.11 network is ‘‘open,’’ anyone is allowed to use it. Otherwise,
credentials are needed to authenticate. The recommended scheme, called WPA2
(WiFi Protected Access 2), implements security as defined in the 802.11i stan-
dard. (Plain WPA is an interim scheme that implements a subset of 802.11i. We
will skip it and go straight to the complete scheme.) With WPA2, the AP can talk
to an authentication server that has a username and password database to deter-
mine if the station is allowed to access the network. Alternatively a pre-shared
key, which is a fancy name for a network password, may be configured. Several
frames are exchanged between the station and the AP with a challenge and re-
sponse that lets the station prove it has the right credentials. This exchange hap-
pens after association.
The scheme that was used before WPA is called WEP (Wired Equivalent
Privacy). For this scheme, authentication with a preshared key happens before
association. However, its use is discouraged because of design flaws that make
WEP easy to compromise. The first practical demonstration that WEP was bro-
ken came when Adam Stubblefield was a summer intern at AT&T (Stubblefield et
al., 2002). He was able to code up and test an attack in one week, much of which
was spent getting permission from management to buy the WiFi cards needed for
experiments. Software to crack WEP passwords is now freely available.
Once frames reach the AP, the distribution service determines how to route
them. If the destination is local to the AP, the frames can be sent out directly over
the air. Otherwise, they will have to be forwarded over the wired network. The

integration service handles any translation that is needed for a frame to be sent
outside the 802.11 LAN, or to arrive from outside the 802.11 LAN. The common
case here is connecting the wireless LAN to the Internet.
Data transmission is what it is all about, so 802.11 naturally provides a data
delivery service. This service lets stations transmit and receive data using the
protocols we described earlier in this chapter. Since 802.11 is modeled on Ether-
net and transmission over Ethernet is not guaranteed to be 100% reliable, trans-
mission over 802.11 is not guaranteed to be reliable either. Higher layers must
deal with detecting and correcting errors.
Wireless is a broadcast signal. For information sent over a wireless LAN to
be kept confidential, it must be encrypted. This goal is accomplished with a pri-
vacy service that manages the details of encryption and decryption. The encryp-
tion algorithm for WPA2 is based on AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), a
U.S. government standard approved in 2002. The keys that are used for en-
cryption are determined during the authentication procedure.
To handle traffic with different priorities, there is a QOS traffic scheduling
service. It uses the protocols we described to give voice and video traffic pre-
ferential treatment compared to best-effort and background traffic. A companion
service also provides higher-layer timer synchronization. This lets stations coordi-
nate their actions, which may be useful for media processing.
Finally, there are two services that help stations manage their use of the spec-
trum. The transmit power control service gives stations the information they
need to meet regulatory limits on transmit power that vary from region to region.
The dynamic frequency selection service give stations the information they need
to avoid transmitting on frequencies in the 5-GHz band that are being used for
radar in the proximity.
With these services, 802.11 provides a rich set of functionality for connecting
nearby mobile clients to the Internet. It has been a huge success, and the standard
has repeatedly been amended to add more functionality. For a perspective on
where the standard has been and where it is heading, see Hiertz et al. (2010).
4.5 BROADBAND WIRELESS
We have been indoors too long. Let us go outdoors, where there is quite a bit
of interesting networking over the so-called ‘‘last mile.’’ With the deregulation of
the telephone systems in many countries, competitors to the entrenched telephone
companies are now often allowed to offer local voice and high-speed Internet ser-
vice. There is certainly plenty of demand. The problem is that running fiber or
coax to millions of homes and businesses is prohibitively expensive. What is a
competitor to do?
The answer is broadband wireless. Erecting a big antenna on a hill just out-
side of town is much easier and cheaper than digging many trenches and stringing

cables. Thus, companies have begun to experiment with providing multimegabit
wireless communication services for voice, Internet, movies on demand, etc.
To stimulate the market, IEEE formed a group to standardize a broadband
wireless metropolitan area network. The next number available in the 802 num-
bering space was 802.16, so the standard got this number. Informally the technol-
ogy is called WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access).
We will use the terms 802.16 and WiMAX interchangeably.
The first 802.16 standard was approved in December 2001. Early versions
provided a wireless local loop between fixed points with a line of sight to each
other. This design soon changed to make WiMAX a more competitive alternative
to cable and DSL for Internet access. By January 2003, 802.16 had been revised
to support non-line-of-sight links by using OFDM technology at frequencies be-
tween 2 GHz and 10 GHz. This change made deployment much easier, though
stations were still fixed locations. The rise of 3G cellular networks posed a threat
by promising high data rates and mobility. In response, 802.16 was enhanced
again to allow mobility at vehicular speeds by December 2005. Mobile broad-
band Internet access is the target of the current standard, IEEE 802.16-2009.
Like the other 802 standards, 802.16 was heavily influenced by the OSI
model, including the (sub)layers, terminology, service primitives, and more. Un-
fortunately, also like OSI, it is fairly complicated. In fact, the WiMAX Forum
was created to define interoperable subsets of the standard for commercial offer-
ings. In the following sections, we will give a brief description of some of the
highlights of the common forms of 802.16 air interface, but this treatment is far

4.5.1 Comparison of 802.16 with 802.11 and 3G
At this point you may be thinking: why devise a new standard? Why not just
use 802.11 or 3G? In fact, WiMAX combines aspects of both 802.11 and 3G,
making it more like a 4G technology.
Like 802.11, WiMAX is all about wirelessly connecting devices to the Inter-
net at megabit/sec speeds, instead of using cable or DSL. The devices may be
mobile, or at least portable. WiMAX did not start by adding low-rate data on the
side of voice-like cellular networks; 802.16 was designed to carry IP packets over
the air and to connect to an IP-based wired network with a minimum of fuss. The
packets may carry peer-to-peer traffic, VoIP calls, or streaming media to support a
range of applications. Also like 802.11, it is based on OFDM technology to
ensure good performance in spite of wireless signal degradations such as mul-
tipath fading, and on MIMO technology to achieve high levels of throughput.
However, WiMAX is more like 3G (and thus unlike 802.11) in several key re-
spects. The key technical problem is to achieve high capacity by the efficient use
of spectrum, so that a large number of subscribers in a coverage area can all get

high throughput. The typical distances are at least 10 times larger than for an
802.11 network. Consequently, WiMAX base stations are more powerful than
802.11 Access Points (APs). To handle weaker signals over larger distances, the
base station uses more power and better antennas, and it performs more proc-
essing to handle errors. To maximize throughput, transmissions are carefully
scheduled by the base station for each particular subscriber; spectrum use is not
left to chance with CSMA/CA, which may waste capacity with collisions.
Licensed spectrum is the expected case for WiMAX, typically around 2.5
GHz in the U.S. The whole system is substantially more optimized than 802.11.
This complexity is worth it, considering the large amount of money involved for
licensed spectrum. Unlike 802.11, the result is a managed and reliable service
with good support for quality of service.
With all of these features, 802.16 most closely resembles the 4G cellular net-
works that are now being standardized under the name LTE (Long Term Evolu-
tion). While 3G cellular networks are based on CDMA and support voice and
data, 4G cellular networks will be based on OFDM with MIMO, and they will tar-
get data, with voice as just one application. It looks like WiMAX and 4G are on a
collision course in terms of technology and applications. Perhaps this conver-
gence is unsurprising, given that the Internet is the killer application and OFDM
and MIMO are the best-known technologies for efficiently using the spectrum.
4.5.2 The 802.16 Architecture and Protocol Stack
The 802.16 architecture is shown in Fig. 4-30. Base stations connect directly
to the provider’s backbone network, which is in turn connected to the Internet.
The base stations communicate with stations over the wireless air interface. Two
kinds of stations exist. Subscriber stations remain in a fixed location, for example,
broadband Internet access for homes. Mobile stations can receive service while
they are moving, for example, a car equipped with WiMAX.
The 802.16 protocol stack that is used across the air interface is shown in
Fig. 4-31. The general structure is similar to that of the other 802 networks, but
with more sublayers. The bottom layer deals with transmission, and here we have
shown only the popular offerings of 802.16, fixed and mobile WiMAX. There is
a different physical layer for each offering. Both layers operate in licensed spec-
trum below 11 GHz and use OFDM, but in different ways.
Above the physical layer, the data link layer consists of three sublayers. The
bottom one deals with privacy and security, which is far more crucial for public
outdoor networks than for private indoor networks. It manages encryption, de-
cryption, and key management.
Next comes the MAC common sublayer part. This part is where the main
protocols, such as channel management, are located. The model here is that the
base station completely controls the system. It can schedule the downlink (i.e.,
base to subscriber) channels very efficiently and plays a major role in managing

the uplink (i.e., subscriber to base) channels as well. An unusual feature of this
MAC sublayer is that, unlike those of the other 802 protocols, it is completely
connection oriented, in order to provide quality of service guarantees for tele-
phony and multimedia communication.
The service-specific convergence sublayer takes the place of the logical link
sublayer in the other 802 protocols. Its function is to provide an interface to the
network layer. Different convergence layers are defined to integrate seamlessly
with different upper layers. The important choice is IP, though the standard
defines mappings for protocols such as Ethernet and ATM too. Since IP is con-
nectionless and the 802.16 MAC sublayer is connection-oriented, this layer must
map between addresses and connections.

4.5.3 The 802.16 Physical Layer
Most WiMAX deployments use licensed spectrum around either 3.5 GHz or
2.5 GHz. As with 3G, finding available spectrum is a key problem. To help, the
802.16 standard is designed for flexibility. It allows operation from 2 GHz to 11
GHz. Channels of different sizes are supported, for example, 3.5 MHz for fixed
WiMAX and from 1.25 MHz to 20 MHz for mobile WiMAX.
Transmissions are sent over these channels with OFDM, the technique we de-
scribed in Sec. 2.5.3. Compared to 802.11, the 802.16 OFDM design is optimized
to make the most out of licensed spectrum and wide area transmissions. The
channel is divided into more subcarriers with a longer symbol duration to tolerate
larger wireless signal degradations; WiMAX parameters are around 20 times larg-
er than comparable 802.11 parameters. For example, in mobile WiMAX there are
512 subcarriers for a 5-MHz channel and the time to send a symbol on each
subcarrier is roughly 100 μsec.
Symbols on each subcarrier are sent with QPSK, QAM-16, or QAM-64, mod-
ulation schemes we described in Sec. 2.5.3. When the mobile or subscriber sta-
tion is near the base station and the received signal has a high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), QAM-64 can be used to send 6 bits per symbol. To reach distant stations
with a low SNR, QPSK can be used to deliver 2 bits per symbol. The data is first
coded for error correction with the convolutional coding (or better schemes) that
we described in Sec. 3.2.1. This coding is common on noisy channels to tolerate
some bit errors without needing to send retransmissions. In fact, the modulation
and coding methods should sound familiar by now as they are used for many net-
works we have studied, including 802.11 cable, and DSL. The net result is that a
base station can support up to 12.6 Mbps of downlink traffic and 6.2 Mbps of
uplink traffic per 5-MHz channel and pair of antennas.
One thing the designers of 802.16 did not like was a certain aspect of the way
GSM and DAMPS work. Both of those systems use equal frequency bands for
upstream and downstream traffic. That is, they implicitly assume there is as much
upstream traffic as downstream traffic. For voice, traffic is symmetric for the
most part, but for Internet access (and certainly Web surfing) there is often more
downstream traffic than upstream traffic. The ratio is often 2:1, 3:1, or more:1.
So, the designers chose a flexible scheme for dividing the channel between
stations, called OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access).
With OFDMA, different sets of subcarriers can be assigned to different stations,
so that more than one station can send or receive at once. If this were 802.11, all
subcarriers would be used by one station to send at any given moment. The added
flexibility in how bandwidth is assigned can increase performance because a
given subcarrier might be faded at one receiver due to multipath effects but clear
at another. Subcarriers can be assigned to the stations that can use them best.
As well as having asymmetric traffic, stations usually alternate between send-
ing and receiving. This method is called TDD (Time Division Duplex). The

---

alternative method, in which a station sends and receives at the same time (on dif-
ferent subcarrier frequencies), is called FDD (Frequency Division Duplex).
WiMAX allows both methods, but TDD is preferred because it is easier to imple-
ment and more flexible.

Fig. 4-32 shows an example of the frame structure that is repeated over time.
It starts with a preamble to synchronize all stations, followed by downlink trans-
missions from the base station. First, the base station sends maps that tell all sta-
tions how the downlink and uplink subcarriers are assigned over the frame. The
base station controls the maps, so it can allocate different amounts of bandwidth
to stations from frame to frame depending on the needs of each station.
Next, the base station sends bursts of traffic to different subscriber and mobile
stations on the subcarriers at the times given in the map. The downlink transmis-
sions end with a guard time for stations to switch from receiving to transmitting.
Finally, the subscriber and mobile stations send their bursts of traffic to the base
station in the uplink positions that were reserved for them in the map. One of
these uplink bursts is reserved for ranging, which is the process by which new
stations adjust their timing and request initial bandwidth to connect to the base
station. Since no connection is set up at this stage, new stations just transmit and
hope there is no collision.
4.5.4 The 802.16 MAC Sublayer Protocol
The data link layer is divided into three sublayers, as we saw in Fig. 4-31.
Since we will not study cryptography until Chap. 8, it is difficult to explain now
how the security sublayer works. Suffice it to say that encryption is used to keep
secret all data transmitted. Only the frame payloads are encrypted; the headers

are not. This property means that a snooper can see who is talking to whom but
cannot tell what they are saying to each other.
If you already know something about cryptography, what follows is a one-
paragraph explanation of the security sublayer. If you know nothing about crypto-
graphy, you are not likely to find the next paragraph terribly enlightening (but you
might consider rereading it after finishing Chap. 8).
When a subscriber connects to a base station, they perform mutual authentica-
tion with RSA public-key cryptography using X.509 certificates. The payloads
themselves are encrypted using a symmetric-key system, either AES (Rijndael) or
DES with cipher block chaining. Integrity checking uses SHA-1. Now that was
not so bad, was it?
Let us now look at the MAC common sublayer part. The MAC sublayer is
connection-oriented and point-to-multipoint, which means that one base station
communicates with multiple subscriber stations. Much of this design is borrowed
from cable modems, in which one cable headend controls the transmissions of
multiple cable modems at the customer premises.
The downlink direction is fairly straightforward. The base station controls the
physical-layer bursts that are used to send information to the different subscriber
stations. The MAC sublayer simply packs its frames into this structure. To reduce
overhead, there are several different options. For example, MAC frames may be
sent individually, or packed back-to-back into a group.
The uplink channel is more complicated since there are competing subscribers
that need access to it. Its allocation is tied closely to the quality of service issue.
Four classes of service are defined, as follows:
1. Constant bit rate service.
2. Real-time variable bit rate service.
3. Non-real-time variable bit rate service.
4. Best-effort service.
All service in 802.16 is connection-oriented. Each connection gets one of these
service classes, determined when the connection is set up. This design is different
from that of 802.11 or Ethernet, which are connectionless in the MAC sublayer.
Constant bit rate service is intended for transmitting uncompressed voice.
This service needs to send a predetermined amount of data at predetermined time
intervals. It is accommodated by dedicating certain bursts to each connection of
this type. Once the bandwidth has been allocated, the bursts are available auto-
matically, without the need to ask for each one.
Real-time variable bit rate service is for compressed multimedia and other
soft real-time applications in which the amount of bandwidth needed at each in-
stant may vary. It is accommodated by the base station polling the subscriber at a
fixed interval to ask how much bandwidth is needed this time.

---

## Page 63

SEC. 4.5
BROADBAND WIRELESS
319
Non-real-time variable bit rate service is for heavy transmissions that are not
real time, such as large file transfers. For this service, the base station polls the
subscriber often, but not at rigidly prescribed time intervals. Connections with
this service can also use best-effort service, described next, to request bandwidth.
Best-effort service is for everything else. No polling is done and the sub-
scriber must contend for bandwidth with other best-effort subscribers. Requests
for bandwidth are sent in bursts marked in the uplink map as available for con-
tention. If a request is successful, its success will be noted in the next downlink
map. If it is not successful, the unsuccessful subscriber have to try again later. To
minimize collisions, the Ethernet binary exponential backoff algorithm is used.
4.5.5 The 802.16 Frame Structure
All MAC frames begin with a generic header. The header is followed by an
optional payload and an optional checksum (CRC), as illustrated in Fig. 4-33.
The payload is not needed in control frames, for example, those requesting chan-
nel slots. The checksum is (surprisingly) also optional, due to the error correction
in the physical layer and the fact that no attempt is ever made to retransmit real-
time frames. If no retransmissions will be attempted, why even bother with a
checksum? But if there is a checksum, it is the standard IEEE 802 CRC, and ac-
knowledgements and retransmissions are used for reliability.

whether the payload is encrypted.
The Type field identifies the frame type,
mostly telling whether packing and fragmentation are present. The CI field indi-
cates the presence or absence of the final checksum. The EK field tells which of
the encryption keys is being used (if any). The Length field gives the complete
length of the frame, including the header. The Connection identifier tells which
connection this frame belongs to. Finally, the Header CRC field is a checksum
over the header only, using the polynomial x 8 + x 2 + x + 1.
The 802.16 protocol has many kinds of frames. An example of a different
type of frame, one that is used to request bandwidth, is shown in Fig. 4-33(b). It

starts with a 1 bit instead of a 0 bit and is otherwise similar to the generic header
except that the second and third bytes form a 16-bit number telling how much
bandwidth is needed to carry the specified number of bytes. Bandwidth request
frames do not carry a payload or full-frame CRC.
A great deal more could be said about 802.16, but this is not the place to say
it. For more information, please consult the IEEE 802.16-2009 standard itself.
4.6 BLUETOOTH
In 1994, the L. M. Ericsson company became interested in connecting its
mobile phones to other devices (e.g., laptops) without cables. Together with four
other companies (IBM, Intel, Nokia, and Toshiba), it formed a SIG (Special Inter-
est Group, i.e., consortium) in 1998 to develop a wireless standard for intercon-
necting computing and communication devices and accessories using short-range,
low-power, inexpensive wireless radios. The project was named Bluetooth, after
Harald Blaatand (Bluetooth) II (940–981), a Viking king who unified (i.e., con-
quered) Denmark and Norway, also without cables.
Bluetooth 1.0 was released in July 1999, and since then the SIG has never
looked back. All manner of consumer electronic devices now use Bluetooth, from
mobile phones and laptops to headsets, printers, keyboards, mice, gameboxes,
watches, music players, navigation units, and more. The Bluetooth protocols let
these devices find and connect to each other, an act called pairing, and securely
transfer data.
The protocols have evolved over the past decade, too. After the initial proto-
cols stabilized, higher data rates were added to Bluetooth 2.0 in 2004. With the
3.0 release in 2009, Bluetooth can be used for device pairing in combination with
802.11 for high-throughput data transfer. The 4.0 release in December 2009 spec-
ified low-power operation. That will be handy for people who do not want to
change the batteries regularly in all of those devices around the house. We will
cover the main aspects of Bluetooth below.
4.6.1 Bluetooth Architecture
Let us start our study of the Bluetooth system with a quick overview of what
it contains and what it is intended to do. The basic unit of a Bluetooth system is a
piconet, which consists of a master node and up to seven active slave nodes with-
in a distance of 10 meters. Multiple piconets can exist in the same (large) room
and can even be connected via a bridge node that takes part in multiple piconets,
as in Fig. 4-34. An interconnected collection of piconets is called a scatternet.
In addition to the seven active slave nodes in a piconet, there can be up to 255
parked nodes in the net. These are devices that the master has switched to a low-
power state to reduce the drain on their batteries. In parked state, a device cannot

do anything except respond to an activation or beacon signal from the master.
Two intermediate power states, hold and sniff, also exist, but these will not con-
cern us here.
The reason for the master/slave design is that the designers intended to facili-
tate the implementation of complete Bluetooth chips for under $5. The conse-
quence of this decision is that the slaves are fairly dumb, basically just doing
whatever the master tells them to do. At its heart, a piconet is a centralized TDM
system, with the master controlling the clock and determining which device gets
to communicate in which time slot. All communication is between the master and
a slave; direct slave-slave communication is not possible.
4.6.2 Bluetooth Applications
Most network protocols just provide channels between communicating enti-
ties and let application designers figure out what they want to use them for. For
example, 802.11 does not specify whether users should use their notebook com-
puters for reading email, surfing the Web, or something else. In contrast, the
Bluetooth SIG specifies particular applications to be supported and provides dif-
ferent protocol stacks for each one. At the time of writing, there are 25 applica-
tions, which are called profiles. Unfortunately, this approach leads to a very large
amount of complexity. We will omit the complexity here but will briefly look at
the profiles to see more clearly what the Bluetooth SIG is trying to accomplish.
Six of the profiles are for different uses of audio and video. For example, the
intercom profile allows two telephones to connect as walkie-talkies. The headset
and hands-free profiles both provide voice communication between a headset and
its base station, as might be used for hands-free telephony while driving a car.

---

## Page 66

322
THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER
CHAP. 4
Other profiles are for streaming stereo-quality audio and video, say, from a port-
able music player to headphones, or from a digital camera to a TV.
The human interface device profile is for connecting keyboards and mice to
computers. Other profiles let a mobile phone or other computer receive images
from a camera or send images to a printer. Perhaps of more interest is a profile to
use a mobile phone as a remote control for a (Bluetooth-enabled) TV.
Still other profiles enable networking. The personal area network profile lets
Bluetooth devices form an ad hoc network or remotely access another network,
such as an 802.11 LAN, via an access point. The dial-up networking profile was
actually the original motivation for the whole project. It allows a notebook com-
puter to connect to a mobile phone containing a built-in modem without using
wires.
Profiles for higher-layer information exchange have also been defined. The
synchronization profile is intended for loading data into a mobile phone when it
leaves home and collecting data from it when it returns.
We will skip the rest of the profiles, except to mention that some profiles
serve as building blocks on which the above profiles are built. The generic access
profile, on which all of the other profiles are built, provides a way to establish and
maintain secure links (channels) between the master and the slaves. The other
generic profiles define the basics of object exchange and audio and video tran-
sport. Utility profiles are used widely for functions such as emulating a serial
line, which is especially useful for many legacy applications.
Was it really necessary to spell out all these applications in detail and provide
different protocol stacks for each one? Probably not, but there were a number of
different working groups that devised different parts of the standard, and each one
just focused on its specific problem and generated its own profile. Think of this
as Conway’s Law in action. (In the April 1968 issue of Datamation magazine,
Melvin Conway observed that if you assign n people to write a compiler, you will
get an n-pass compiler, or more generally, the software structure mirrors the struc-
ture of the group that produced it.) It would probably have been possible to get
away with two protocol stacks instead of 25, one for file transfer and one for
streaming real-time communication.
4.6.3 The Bluetooth Protocol Stack
The Bluetooth standard has many protocols grouped loosely into the layers
shown in Fig. 4-35. The first observation to make is that the structure does not
follow the OSI model, the TCP/IP model, the 802 model, or any other model.
The bottom layer is the physical radio layer, which corresponds fairly well to
the physical layer in the OSI and 802 models. It deals with radio transmission and
modulation. Many of the concerns here have to do with the goal of making the
system inexpensive so that it can become a mass-market item.

The link control (or baseband) layer is somewhat analogous to the MAC sub-
layer but also includes elements of the physical layer. It deals with how the mas-
ter controls time slots and how these slots are grouped into frames.
Next come two protocols that use the link control protocol. The link manager
handles the establishment of logical channels between devices, including power
management, pairing and encryption, and quality of service. It lies below the host
controller interface line. This interface is a convenience for implementation: typi-
cally, the protocols below the line will be implemented on a Bluetooth chip, and
the protocols above the line will be implemented on the Bluetooth device that
hosts the chip.
The link protocol above the line is L2CAP (Logical Link Control Adapta-
tion Protocol). It frames variable-length messages and provides reliability if
needed. Many protocols use L2CAP, such as the two utility protocols that are
shown. The service discovery protocol is used to locate services within the net-
work. The RFcomm (Radio Frequency communication) protocol emulates the
standard serial port found on PCs for connecting the keyboard, mouse, and
modem, among other devices.
The top layer is where the applications are located. The profiles are repres-
ented by vertical boxes because they each define a slice of the protocol stack for a
particular purpose. Specific profiles, such as the headset profile, usually contain
only those protocols needed by that application and no others. For example, pro-
files may include L2CAP if they have packets to send but skip L2CAP if they
have only a steady flow of audio samples.
In the following sections, we will examine the Bluetooth radio layer and vari-
ous link protocols, since these roughly correspond to the physical and MAC
sublayers in the other procotol stacks we have studied.

4.6.4 The Bluetooth Radio Layer
The radio layer moves the bits from master to slave, or vice versa. It is a
low-power system with a range of 10 meters operating in the same 2.4-GHz ISM
band as 802.11. The band is divided into 79 channels of 1 MHz each. To coexist
with other networks using the ISM band, frequency hopping spread spectrum is
used. There can be up to 1600 hops/sec over slots with a dwell time of 625 μsec.
All the nodes in a piconet hop frequencies simultaneously, following the slot tim-
ing and pseudorandom hop sequence dictated by the master.
Unfortunately, it turned out that early versions of Bluetooth and 802.11 inter-
fered enough to ruin each other’s transmissions. Some companies responded by
banning Bluetooth altogether, but eventually a technical solution was devised.
The solution is for Bluetooth to adapt its hop sequence to exclude channels on
which there are other RF signals. This process reduces the harmful interference.
It is called adaptive frequency hopping.
Three forms of modulation are used to send bits on a channel. The basic
scheme is to use frequency shift keying to send a 1-bit symbol every microsecond,
giving a gross data rate of 1 Mbps. Enhanced rates were introduced with the 2.0
version of Bluetooth. These rates use phase shift keying to send either 2 or 3 bits
per symbol, for gross data rates of 2 or 3 Mbps. The enhanced rates are only used
in the data portion of frames.
4.6.5 The Bluetooth Link Layers
The link control (or baseband) layer is the closest thing Bluetooth has to a
MAC sublayer. It turns the raw bit stream into frames and defines some key for-
mats. In the simplest form, the master in each piconet defines a series of 625-
μsec time slots, with the master’s transmissions starting in the even slots and the
slaves’ transmissions starting in the odd ones. This scheme is traditional time di-
vision multiplexing, with the master getting half the slots and the slaves sharing
the other half. Frames can be 1, 3, or 5 slots long. Each frame has an overhead of
126 bits for an access code and header, plus a settling time of 250–260 μsec per
hop to allow the inexpensive radio circuits to become stable. The payload of the
frame can be encrypted for confidentiality with a key that is chosen when the
master and slave connect. Hops only happen between frames, not during a frame.
The result is that a 5-slot frame is much more efficient than a 1-slot frame because
the overhead is constant but more data is sent.
The link manager protocol sets up logical channels, called links, to carry
frames between the master and a slave device that have discovered each other. A
pairing procedure is followed to make sure that the two devices are allowed to
communicate before the link is used. The old pairing method is that both devices
must be configured with the same four-digit PIN (Personal Identification Num-
ber). The matching PIN is how each device would know that it was connecting to

---

## Page 69

SEC. 4.6
BLUETOOTH
325
the right remote device. However, unimaginative users and devices default to
PINs such as ‘‘0000’’ and ‘‘1234’’ meant that this method provided very little se-
curity in practice.
The new secure simple pairing method enables users to confirm that both de-
vices are displaying the same passkey, or to observe the passkey on one device
and enter it into the second device. This method is more secure because users do
not have to choose or set a PIN. They merely confirm a longer, device-generated
passkey. Of course, it cannot be used on some devices with limited input/output,
such as a hands-free headset.
Once pairing is complete, the link manager protocol sets up the links. Two
main kinds of links exist to carry user data. The first is the SCO (Synchronous
Connection Oriented) link. It is used for real-time data, such as telephone con-
nections. This type of link is allocated a fixed slot in each direction. A slave may
have up to three SCO links with its master. Each SCO link can transmit one
64,000-bps PCM audio channel. Due to the time-critical nature of SCO links,
frames sent over them are never retransmitted. Instead, forward error correction
can be used to increase reliability.
The other kind is the ACL (Asynchronous ConnectionLess) link. This type
of link is used for packet-switched data that is available at irregular intervals.
ACL traffic is delivered on a best-effort basis. No guarantees are given. Frames
can be lost and may have to be retransmitted. A slave may have only one ACL
link to its master.
The data sent over ACL links come from the L2CAP layer. This layer has
four major functions. First, it accepts packets of up to 64 KB from the upper lay-
ers and breaks them into frames for transmission. At the far end, the frames are
reassembled into packets. Second, it handles the multiplexing and demultiplexing
of multiple packet sources. When a packet has been reassembled, the L2CAP
layer determines which upper-layer protocol to hand it to, for example, RFcomm
or service discovery. Third, L2CAP handles error control and retransmission. It
detects errors and resends packets that were not acknowledged. Finally, L2CAP
enforces quality of service requirements between multiple links.
4.6.6 The Bluetooth Frame Structure
Bluetooth defines several frame formats, the most important of which is
shown in two forms in Fig. 4-36. It begins with an access code that usually identi-
fies the master so that slaves within radio range of two masters can tell which traf-
fic is for them. Next comes a 54-bit header containing typical MAC sublayer
fields. If the frame is sent at the basic rate, the data field comes next. It has up to
2744 bits for a five-slot transmission. For a single time slot, the format is the
same except that the data field is 240 bits.
If the frame is sent at the enhanced rate, the data portion may have up to two
or three times as many bits because each symbol carries 2 or 3 bits instead of 1

bit. These data are preceded by a guard field and a synchronization pattern that is
used to switch to the faster data rate. That is, the access code and header are car-
ried at the basic rate and only the data portion is carried at the faster rate.
Enhanced-rate frames end with a short trailer.
Let us take a quick look at the common header. The Address field identifies
which of the eight active devices the frame is intended for. The Type field identi-
fies the frame type (ACL, SCO, poll, or null), the type of error correction used in
the data field, and how many slots long the frame is. The Flow bit is asserted by a
slave when its buffer is full and cannot receive any more data. This bit enables a
primitive form of flow control. The Acknowledgement bit is used to piggyback an
ACK onto a frame. The Sequence bit is used to number the frames to detect re-
transmissions. The protocol is stop-and-wait, so 1 bit is enough. Then comes the
8-bit header Checksum. The entire 18-bit header is repeated three times to form
the 54-bit header shown in Fig. 4-36. On the receiving side, a simple circuit ex-
amines all three copies of each bit. If all three are the same, the bit is accepted. If
not, the majority opinion wins. Thus, 54 bits of transmission capacity are used to
send 10 bits of header. The reason is that to reliably send data in a noisy environ-
ment using cheap, low-powered (2.5 mW) devices with little computing capacity,
a great deal of redundancy is needed.
Various formats are used for the data field for ACL and SCO frames. The
basic-rate SCO frames are a simple example to study: the data field is always 240
bits. Three variants are defined, permitting 80, 160, or 240 bits of actual payload,
with the rest being used for error correction. In the most reliable version (80-bit
payload), the contents are just repeated three times, the same as the header.
We can work out the capacity with this frame as follows. Since the slave may
use only the odd slots, it gets 800 slots/sec, just as the master does. With an 80-bit

payload, the channel capacity from the slave is 64,000 bps as is the channel ca-
pacity from the master. This capacity is exactly enough for a single full-duplex
PCM voice channel (which is why a hop rate of 1600 hops/sec was chosen). That
is, despite a raw bandwidth of 1 Mbps, a single full-duplex uncompressed voice
channel can completely saturate the piconet. The efficiency of 13% is the result
of spending 41% of the capacity on settling time, 20% on headers, and 26% on
repetition coding. This shortcoming highlights the value of the enhanced rates
and frames of more than a single slot.
There is much more to be said about Bluetooth, but no more space to say it
here. For the curious, the Bluetooth 4.0 specification contains all the details.
4.7 RFID
We have looked at MAC designs from LANs up to MANs and down to PANs.
As a last example, we will study a category of low-end wireless devices that peo-
ple may not recognize as forming a computer network: the RFID (Radio Fre-
quency IDentification) tags and readers that we described in Sec. 1.5.4.
RFID technology takes many forms, used in smartcards, implants for pets,
passports, library books, and more. The form that we will look at was developed
in the quest for an EPC (Electronic Product Code) that started with the Auto-ID
Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999. An EPC is a re-
placement for a barcode that can carry a larger amount of information and is elec-
tronically readable over distances up to 10 m, even when it is not visible. It is dif-
ferent technology than, for example, the RFID used in passports,which must be
placed quite close to a reader to perform a transaction. The ability to communi-
cate over a distance makes EPCs more relevant to our studies.
EPCglobal was formed in 2003 to commercialize the RFID technology devel-
oped by the Auto-ID Center. The effort got a boost in 2005 when Walmart re-
quired its top 100 suppliers to label all shipments with RFID tags. Widespread
deployment has been hampered by the difficulty of competing with cheap printed
barcodes, but new uses, such as in drivers licenses, are now growing. We will de-
scribe the second generation of this technology, which is informally called EPC
Gen 2 (EPCglobal, 2008).
4.7.1 EPC Gen 2 Architecture
The architecture of an EPC Gen 2 RFID network is shown in Fig. 4-37. It has
two key components: tags and readers. RFID tags are small, inexpensive devices
that have a unique 96-bit EPC identifier and a small amount of memory that can
be read and written by the RFID reader. The memory might be used to record the
location history of an item, for example, as it moves through the supply chain.

Often, the tags look like stickers that can be placed on, for example, pairs of
jeans on the shelves in a store. Most of the sticker is taken up by an antenna that is
printed onto it. A tiny dot in the middle is the RFID integrated circuit. Alterna-
tively, the RFID tags can be integrated into an object, such as a driver’s license. In
both cases, the tags have no battery and they must gather power from the radio
transmissions of a nearby RFID reader to run. This kind of tag is called a ‘‘Class
1’’ tag to distinguish it from more capable tags that have batteries.

The readers are the intelligence in the system, analogous to base stations and
access points in cellular and WiFi networks. Readers are much more powerful
than tags. They have their own power sources, often have multiple antennas, and
are in charge of when tags send and receive messages. As there will commonly
be multiple tags within the reading range, the readers must solve the multiple ac-
cess problem. There may be multiple readers that can contend with each other in
the same area, too.
The main job of the reader is to inventory the tags in the neighborhood, that
is, to discover the identifiers of the nearby tags. The inventory is accomplished
with the physical layer protocol and the tag-identification protocol that are out-
lined in the following sections.
4.7.2 EPC Gen 2 Physical Layer
The physical layer defines how bits are sent between the RFID reader and
tags. Much of it uses methods for sending wireless signals that we have seen pre-
viously. In the U.S., transmissions are sent in the unlicensed 902–928 MHz ISM
band. This band falls in the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) range, so the tags are
referred to as UHF RFID tags. The reader performs frequency hopping at least
every 400 msec to spread its signal across the channel, to limit interference and
satisfy regulatory requirements. The reader and tags use forms of ASK (Ampli-
tude Shift Keying) modulation that we described in Sec. 2.5.2 to encode bits.
They take turns to send bits, so the link is half duplex.

There are two main differences from other physical layers that we have stud-
ied. The first is that the reader is always transmitting a signal, regardless of
whether it is the reader or tag that is communicating. Naturally, the reader trans-
mits a signal to send bits to tags. For the tags to send bits to the reader, the reader
transmits a fixed carrier signal that carries no bits. The tags harvest this signal to
get the power they need to run; otherwise, a tag would not be able to transmit in
the first place. To send data, a tag changes whether it is reflecting the signal from
the reader, like a radar signal bouncing off a target, or absorbing it.
This method is called backscatter. It differs from all the other wireless situa-
tions we have seen so far, in which the sender and receiver never both transmit at
the same time. Backscatter is a low-energy way for the tag to create a weak sig-
nal of its own that shows up at the reader. For the reader to decode the incoming
signal, it must filter out the outgoing signal that it is transmitting. Because the tag
signal is weak, tags can only send bits to the reader at a low rate, and tags cannot
receive or even sense transmissions from other tags.
The second difference is that very simple forms of modulation are used so that
they can be implemented on a tag that runs on very little power and costs only a
few cents to make. To send data to the tags, the reader uses two amplitude levels.
Bits are determined to be either a 0 or a 1, depending on how long the reader
waits before a low-power period. The tag measures the time between low-power
periods and compares this time to a reference measured during a preamble. As
shown in Fig. 4-38, 1s are longer than 0s.
Tag responses consist of the tag alternating its backscatter state at fixed inter-
vals to create a series of pulses in the signal. Anywhere from one to eight pulse
periods can be used to encode each 0 or 1, depending on the need for reliability.
1s have fewer transitions than 0s, as is shown with an example of two-pulse
period coding in Fig. 4-38.

4.7.3 EPC Gen 2 Tag Identification Layer
To inventory the nearby tags, the reader needs to receive a message from each
tag that gives the identifier for the tag. This situation is a multiple access problem
for which the number of tags is unknown in the general case. The reader might

broadcast a query to ask all tags to send their identifiers. However, tags that re-
plied right away would then collide in much the same way as stations on a classic
Ethernet.
We have seen many ways of tackling the multiple access problem in this
chapter. The closest protocol for the current situation, in which the tags cannot
hear each others’ transmissions, is slotted ALOHA, one of the earliest protocols
we studied. This protocol is adapted for use in Gen 2 RFID.
The sequence of messages used to identify a tag is shown in Fig. 4-39. In the
first slot (slot 0), the reader sends a Query message to start the process. Each
QRepeat message advances to the next slot. The reader also tells the tags the
range of slots over which to randomize transmissions. Using a range is necessary
because the reader synchronizes tags when it starts the process; unlike stations on
an Ethernet, tags do not wake up with a message at a time of their choosing.

Figure 4-39. Example message exchange to identify a tag.
Tags pick a random slot in which to reply. In Fig. 4-39, the tag replies in slot
2. However, tags do not send their identifiers when they first reply. Instead, a tag
sends a short 16-bit random number in an RN16 message. If there is no collision,
the reader receives this message and sends an ACK message of its own. At this
stage, the tag has acquired the slot and sends its EPC identifier.
The reason for this exchange is that EPC identifiers are long, so collisions on
these messages would be expensive. Instead, a short exchange is used to test
whether the tag can safely use the slot to send its identifier. Once its identifier has
been successfully transmitted, the tag temporarily stops responding to new Query
messages so that all the remaining tags can be identified.

A key problem is for the reader to adjust the number of slots to avoid collis-
ions, but without using so many slots that performance suffers. This adjustment is
analogous to binary exponential backoff in Ethernet. If the reader sees too many
slots with no responses or too many slots with collisions, it can send a QAdjust
message to decrease or increase the range of slots over which the tags are re-
sponding.
The RFID reader can perform other operations on the tags. For example, it
can select a subset of tags before running an inventory, allowing it to collect re-
sponses from, say, tagged jeans but not tagged shirts. The reader can also write
data to tags as they are identified. This feature could be used to record the point of
sale or other relevant information.
4.7.4 Tag Identification Message Formats
The format of the Query message is shown in Fig. 4-40 as an example of a
reader-to-tag message. The message is compact because the downlink rates are
limited, from 27 kbps up to 128 kbps. The Command field carries the code 1000
to identify the message as a Query.

The next flags, DR, M, and TR, determine the physical layer parameters for
reader transmissions and tag responses. For example, the response rate may be set
to between 5 kbps and 640 kbps. We will skip over the details of these flags.
Then come three fields, Sel, Session, and Target, that select the tags to re-
spond. As well as the readers being able to select a subset of identifiers, the tags
keep track of up to four concurrent sessions and whether they have been identified
in those sessions. In this way, multiple readers can operate in overlapping cover-
age areas by using different sessions.
Next is the most important parameter for this command, Q. This field defines
the range of slots over which tags will respond, from 0 to 2Q−1. Finally, there is a
CRC to protect the message fields. At 5 bits, it is shorter than most CRCs we have
seen, but the Query message is much shorter than most packets too.
Tag-to-reader messages are simpler. Since the reader is in control, it knows
what message to expect in response to each of its transmissions. The tag re-
sponses simply carry data, such as the EPC identifier.

Originally the tags were just for identification purposes. However, they have
grown over time to resemble very small computers. Some research tags have sen-
sors and are able to run small programs to gather and process data (Sample et al.,
2008). One vision for this technology is the ‘‘Internet of things’’ that connects ob-
jects in the physical world to the Internet (Welbourne et al., 2009; and Gershen-
feld et al., 2004).
4.8 DATA LINK LAYER SWITCHING
Many organizations have multiple LANs and wish to connect them. Would it
not be convenient if we could just join the LANs together to make a larger LAN?
In fact, we can do this when the connections are made with devices called
bridges. The Ethernet switches we described in Sec. 4.3.4 are a modern name for
bridges; they provide functionality that goes beyond classic Ethernet and Ethernet
hubs to make it easy to join multiple LANs into a larger and faster network. We
shall use the terms ‘‘bridge’’ and ‘‘switch’’ interchangeably.
Bridges operate in the data link layer, so they examine the data link layer ad-
dresses to forward frames. Since they are not supposed to examine the payload
field of the frames they forward, they can handle IP packets as well as other kinds
of packets, such as AppleTalk packets. In contrast, routers examine the addresses
in packets and route based on them, so they only work with the protocols that they
were designed to handle.
In this section, we will look at how bridges work and are used to join multiple
physical LANs into a single logical LAN. We will also look at how to do the re-
verse and treat one physical LAN as multiple logical LANs, called VLANs (Vir-
tual LANs). Both technologies provide useful flexibility for managing networks.
For a comprehensive treatment of bridges, switches, and related topics, see Seifert
and Edwards (2008) and Perlman (2000).
4.8.1 Uses of Bridges
Before getting into the technology of bridges, let us take a look at some com-
mon situations in which bridges are used. We will mention three reasons why a
single organization may end up with multiple LANs.
First, many university and corporate departments have their own LANs to
connect their own personal computers, servers, and devices such as printers.
Since the goals of the various departments differ, different departments may set
up different LANs, without regard to what other departments are doing. Sooner
or later, though, there is a need for interaction, so bridges are needed. In this ex-
ample, multiple LANs come into existence due to the autonomy of their owners.

Second, the organization may be geographically spread over several buildings
separated by considerable distances. It may be cheaper to have separate LANs in
each building and connect them with bridges and a few long-distance fiber optic
links than to run all the cables to a single central switch. Even if laying the cables
is easy to do, there are limits on their lengths (e.g., 200 m for twisted-pair gigabit
Ethernet). The network would not work for longer cables due to the excessive
signal attenuation or round-trip delay. The only solution is to partition the LAN
and install bridges to join the pieces to increase the total physical distance that can
be covered.
Third, it may be necessary to split what is logically a single LAN into sepa-
rate LANs (connected by bridges) to accommodate the load. At many large uni-
versities, for example, thousands of workstations are available for student and
faculty computing. Companies may also have thousands of employees. The scale
of this system precludes putting all the workstations on a single LAN—there are
more computers than ports on any Ethernet hub and more stations than allowed on
a single classic Ethernet.
Even if it were possible to wire all the workstations together, putting more
stations on an Ethernet hub or classic Ethernet would not add capacity. All of the
stations share the same, fixed amount of bandwidth. The more stations there are,
the less average bandwidth per station.
However, two separate LANs have twice the capacity of a single LAN.
Bridges let the LANs be joined together while keeping this capacity. The key is
not to send traffic onto ports where it is not needed, so that each LAN can run at
full speed. This behavior also increases reliability, since on a single LAN a defec-
tive node that keeps outputting a continuous stream of garbage can clog up the en-
tire LAN. By deciding what to forward and what not to forward, bridges act like
fire doors in a building, preventing a single node that has gone berserk from bring-
ing down the entire system.
To make these benefits easily available, ideally bridges should be completely
transparent. It should be possible to go out and buy bridges, plug the LAN cables
into the bridges, and have everything work perfectly, instantly. There should be
no hardware changes required, no software changes required, no setting of address
switches, no downloading of routing tables or parameters, nothing at all. Just plug
in the cables and walk away. Furthermore, the operation of the existing LANs
should not be affected by the bridges at all. As far as the stations are concerned,
there should be no observable difference whether or not they are part of a bridged
LAN. It should be as easy to move stations around the bridged LAN as it is to
move them around a single LAN.
Surprisingly enough, it is actually possible to create bridges that are transpar-
ent. Two algorithms are used: a backward learning algorithm to stop traffic being
sent where it is not needed; and a spanning tree algorithm to break loops that may
be formed when switches are cabled together willy-nilly. Let us now take a look
at these algorithms in turn to learn how this magic is accomplished.

4.8.2 Learning Bridges
The topology of two LANs bridged together is shown in Fig. 4-41 for two
cases. On the left-hand side, two multidrop LANs, such as classic Ethernets, are
joined by a special station—the bridge—that sits on both LANs. On the right-hand
side, LANs with point-to-point cables, including one hub, are joined together. The
bridges are the devices to which the stations and hub are attached. If the LAN
technology is Ethernet, the bridges are better known as Ethernet switches.

hub) connecting seven point-to-point stations.
Bridges were developed when classic Ethernets were in use, so they are often
shown in topologies with multidrop cables, as in Fig. 4-41(a). However, all the
topologies that are encountered today are comprised of point-to-point cables and
switches. The bridges work the same way in both settings. All of the stations at-
tached to the same port on a bridge belong to the same collision domain, and this
is different than the collision domain for other ports. If there is more than one sta-
tion, as in a classic Ethernet, a hub, or a half-duplex link, the CSMA/CD protocol
is used to send frames.
There is a difference, however, in how the bridged LANs are built. To bridge
multidrop LANs, a bridge is added as a new station on each of the multidrop
LANs, as in Fig. 4-41(a). To bridge point-to-point LANs, the hubs are either con-
nected to a bridge or, preferably, replaced with a bridge to increase performance.
In Fig. 4-41(b), bridges have replaced all but one hub.
Different kinds of cables can also be attached to one bridge. For example, the
cable connecting bridge B1 to bridge B2 in Fig. 4-41(b) might be a long-distance
fiber optic link, while the cable connecting the bridges to stations might be a
short-haul twisted-pair line. This arrangement is useful for bridging LANs in dif-
ferent buildings.
Now let us consider what happens inside the bridges. Each bridge operates in
promiscuous mode, that is, it accepts every frame transmitted by the stations

attached to each of its ports. The bridge must decide whether to forward or dis-
card each frame, and, if the former, on which port to output the frame. This decis-
ion is made by using the destination address. As an example, consider the topo-
logy of Fig. 4-41(a). If station A sends a frame to station B, bridge B1 will receive
the frame on port 1. This frame can be immediately discarded without further ado
because it is already on the correct port. However, in the topology of Fig. 4-41(b)
suppose that A sends a frame to D. Bridge B1 will receive the frame on port 1 and
output it on port 4. Bridge B2 will then receive the frame on its port 4 and output
it on its port 1.
A simple way to implement this scheme is to have a big (hash) table inside the
bridge. The table can list each possible destination and which output port it be-
longs on. For example, in Fig. 4-41(b), the table at B1 would list D as belonging
to port 4, since all B1 has to know is which port to put frames on to reach D.
That, in fact, more forwarding will happen later when the frame hits B2 is not of
interest to B1.
When the bridges are first plugged in, all the hash tables are empty. None of
the bridges know where any of the destinations are, so they use a flooding algo-
rithm: every incoming frame for an unknown destination is output on all the ports
to which the bridge is connected except the one it arrived on. As time goes on,
the bridges learn where destinations are. Once a destination is known, frames
destined for it are put only on the proper port; they are not flooded.
The algorithm used by the bridges is backward learning. As mentioned
above, the bridges operate in promiscuous mode, so they see every frame sent on
any of their ports. By looking at the source addresses, they can tell which ma-
chines are accessible on which ports. For example, if bridge B1 in Fig. 4-41(b)
sees a frame on port 3 coming from C, it knows that C must be reachable via port
3, so it makes an entry in its hash table. Any subsequent frame addressed to C
coming in to B1 on any other port will be forwarded to port 3.
The topology can change as machines and bridges are powered up and down
and moved around. To handle dynamic topologies, whenever a hash table entry is
made, the arrival time of the frame is noted in the entry. Whenever a frame
whose source is already in the table arrives, its entry is updated with the current
time. Thus, the time associated with every entry tells the last time a frame from
that machine was seen.
Periodically, a process in the bridge scans the hash table and purges all entries
more than a few minutes old. In this way, if a computer is unplugged from its
LAN, moved around the building, and plugged in again somewhere else, within a
few minutes it will be back in normal operation, without any manual intervention.
This algorithm also means that if a machine is quiet for a few minutes, any traffic
sent to it will have to be flooded until it next sends a frame itself.
The routing procedure for an incoming frame depends on the port it arrives on
(the source port) and the address to which it is destined (the destination address).
The procedure is as follows.

---

## Page 80

THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER
CHAP. 4
1. If the port for the destination address is the same as the source port,
discard the frame.
2. If the port for the destination address and the source port are dif-
ferent, forward the frame on to the destination port.
3. If the destination port is unknown, use flooding and send the frame
on all ports except the source port.
You might wonder whether the first case can occur with point-to-point links. The
answer is that it can occur if hubs are used to connect a group of computers to a
bridge. An example is shown in Fig. 4-41(b) where stations E and F are connected
to hub H 1, which is in turn connected to bridge B2. If E sends a frame to F, the
hub will relay it to B2 as well as to F. That is what hubs do—they wire all ports
together so that a frame input on one port is simply output on all other ports. The
frame will arrive at B2 on port 4, which is already the right output port to reach
the destination. Bridge B2 need only discard the frame.
As each frame arrives, this algorithm must be applied, so it is usually imple-
mented with special-purpose VLSI chips. The chips do the lookup and update the
table entry, all in a few microseconds. Because bridges only look at the MAC ad-
dresses to decide how to forward frames, it is possible to start forwarding as soon
as the destination header field has come in, before the rest of the frame has arrived
(provided the output line is available, of course). This design reduces the latency
of passing through the bridge, as well as the number of frames that the bridge
must be able to buffer. It is referred to as cut-through switching or wormhole
routing and is usually handled in hardware.
We can look at the operation of a bridge in terms of protocol stacks to under-
stand what it means to be a link layer device. Consider a frame sent from station A
to station D in the configuration of Fig. 4-41(a), in which the LANs are Ethernet.
The frame will pass through one bridge. The protocol stack view of processing is
shown in Fig. 4-42.
The packet comes from a higher layer and descends into the Ethernet MAC
layer. It acquires an Ethernet header (and also a trailer, not shown in the figure).
This unit is passed to the physical layer, goes out over the cable, and is picked up
by the bridge.
In the bridge, the frame is passed up from the physical layer to the Ethernet
MAC layer. This layer has extended processing compared to the Ethernet MAC
layer at a station. It passes the frame to a relay, still within the MAC layer. The
bridge relay function uses only the Ethernet MAC header to determine how to
handle the frame. In this case, it passes the frame to the Ethernet MAC layer of
the port used to reach station D, and the frame continues on its way.
In the general case, relays at a given layer can rewrite the headers for that
layer. VLANs will provide an example shortly. In no case should the bridge look
inside the frame and learn that it is carrying an IP packet; that is irrelevant to the

with k ports will have k instances of MAC and physical layers. The value of k is 2
for our simple example.
4.8.3 Spanning Tree Bridges
To increase reliability, redundant links can be used between bridges. In the
example of Fig. 4-43, there are two links in parallel between a pair of bridges.
This design ensures that if one link is cut, the network will not be partitioned into
two sets of computers that cannot talk to each other.

However, this redundancy introduces some additional problems because it
creates loops in the topology. An example of these problems can be seen by look-
ing at how a frame sent by A to a previously unobserved destination is handled in
Fig. 4-43. Each bridge follows the normal rule for handling unknown destina-
tions, which is to flood the frame. Call the frame from A that reaches bridge B1
frame F 0. The bridge sends copies of this frame out all of its other ports. We

will only consider the bridge ports that connect B1 to B2 (though the frame will be
sent out the other ports, too). Since there are two links from B1 to B2, two copies
of the frame will reach B2. They are shown in Fig. 4-43 as F 1 and F 2.
Shortly thereafter, bridge B2 receives these frames. However, it does not (and
cannot) know that they are copies of the same frame, rather than two different
frames sent one after the other. So bridge B2 takes F 1 and sends copies of it out
all the other ports, and it also takes F 2 and sends copies of it out all the other
ports. This produces frames F 3 and F 4 that are sent along the two links back to
B1. Bridge B1 then sees two new frames with unknown destinations and copies
them again. This cycle goes on forever.
The solution to this difficulty is for the bridges to communicate with each
other and overlay the actual topology with a spanning tree that reaches every
bridge. In effect, some potential connections between bridges are ignored in the
interest of constructing a fictitious loop-free topology that is a subset of the actual
topology.
For example, in Fig. 4-44 we see five bridges that are interconnected and also
have stations connected to them. Each station connects to only one bridge. There
are some redundant connections between the bridges so that frames will be for-
warded in loops if all of the links are used. This topology can be thought of as a
graph in which the bridges are the nodes and the point-to-point links are the
edges. The graph can be reduced to a spanning tree, which has no cycles by defi-
nition, by dropping the links shown as dashed lines in Fig. 4-44. Using this span-
ning tree, there is exactly one path from every station to every other station. Once
the bridges have agreed on the spanning tree, all forwarding between stations fol-
lows the spanning tree. Since there is a unique path from each source to each
destination, loops are impossible.

bridge periodically broadcasts a configuration message out all of its ports to its

neighbors and processes the messages it receives from other bridges, as described
next. These messages are not forwarded, since their purpose is to build the tree,
which can then be used for forwarding.
The bridges must first choose one bridge to be the root of the spanning tree.
To make this choice, they each include an identifier based on their MAC address
in the configuration message, as well as the identifier of the bridge they believe to
be the root. MAC addresses are installed by the manufacturer and guaranteed to
be unique worldwide, which makes these identifiers convenient and unique. The
bridges choose the bridge with the lowest identifier to be the root. After enough
messages have been exchanged to spread the news, all bridges will agree on
which bridge is the root. In Fig. 4-44, bridge B1 has the lowest identifier and be-
comes the root.
Next, a tree of shortest paths from the root to every bridge is constructed. In
Fig. 4-44, bridges B2 and B3 can each be reached from bridge B1 directly, in one
hop that is a shortest path. Bridge B4 can be reached in two hops, via either B2 or
B3. To break this tie, the path via the bridge with the lowest identifier is chosen,
so B4 is reached via B2. Bridge B5 can be reached in two hops via B3.
To find these shortest paths, bridges include the distance from the root in their
configuration messages. Each bridge remembers the shortest path it finds to the
root. The bridges then turn off ports that are not part of the shortest path.
Although the tree spans all the bridges, not all the links (or even bridges) are
necessarily present in the tree. This happens because turning off the ports prunes
some links from the network to prevent loops. Even after the spanning tree has
been established, the algorithm continues to run during normal operation to auto-
matically detect topology changes and update the tree.
The algorithm for constructing the spanning tree was invented by Radia Perl-
man. Her job was to solve the problem of joining LANs without loops. She was
given a week to do it, but she came up with the idea for the spanning tree algo-
rithm in a day. Fortunately, this left her enough time to write it as a poem (Perl-
man, 1985):
I think that I shall never see
A graph more lovely than a tree.
A tree whose crucial property
Is loop-free connectivity.
A tree which must be sure to span.
So packets can reach every LAN.
First the Root must be selected
By ID it is elected.
Least cost paths from Root are traced
In the tree these paths are placed.
A mesh is made by folks like me
Then bridges find a spanning tree.

The spanning tree algorithm was then standardized as IEEE 802.1D and used for
many years. In 2001, it was revised to more rapidly find a new spanning tree after
a topology change. For a detailed treatment of bridges, see Perlman (2000).
4.8.4 Repeaters, Hubs, Bridges, Switches, Routers, and Gateways
So far in this book, we have looked at a variety of ways to get frames and
packets from one computer to another.
We have mentioned repeaters, hubs,
bridges, switches, routers, and gateways. All of these devices are in common use,
but they all differ in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Since there are so many of
them, it is probably worth taking a look at them together to see what the simi-
larities and differences are.
The key to understanding these devices is to realize that they operate in dif-
ferent layers, as illustrated in Fig. 4-45(a). The layer matters because different
devices use different pieces of information to decide how to switch. In a typical
scenario, the user generates some data to be sent to a remote machine. Those data
are passed to the transport layer, which then adds a header (for example, a TCP
header) and passes the resulting unit down to the network layer. The network
layer adds its own header to form a network layer packet (e.g., an IP packet). In
Fig. 4-45(b), we see the IP packet shaded in gray. Then the packet goes to the
data link layer, which adds its own header and checksum (CRC) and gives the re-
sulting frame to the physical layer for transmission, for example, over a LAN.

Now let us look at the switching devices and see how they relate to the pack-
ets and frames. At the bottom, in the physical layer, we find the repeaters. These
are analog devices that work with signals on the cables to which they are con-
nected. A signal appearing on one cable is cleaned up, amplified, and put out on
another cable. Repeaters do not understand frames, packets, or headers. They un-
derstand the symbols that encode bits as volts. Classic Ethernet, for example, was

DATA LINK LAYER SWITCHING
341
designed to allow four repeaters that would boost the signal to extend the maxi-
mum cable length from 500 meters to 2500 meters.
Next we come to the hubs. A hub has a number of input lines that it joins
electrically. Frames arriving on any of the lines are sent out on all the others. If
two frames arrive at the same time, they will collide, just as on a coaxial cable.
All the lines coming into a hub must operate at the same speed. Hubs differ from
repeaters in that they do not (usually) amplify the incoming signals and are de-
signed for multiple input lines, but the differences are slight. Like repeaters, hubs
are physical layer devices that do not examine the link layer addresses or use them
in any way.
Now let us move up to the data link layer, where we find bridges and switch-
es. We just studied bridges at some length. A bridge connects two or more
LANs. Like a hub, a modern bridge has multiple ports, usually enough for 4 to 48
input lines of a certain type. Unlike in a hub, each port is isolated to be its own
collision domain; if the port has a full-duplex point-to-point line, the CSMA/CD
algorithm is not needed. When a frame arrives, the bridge extracts the destination
address from the frame header and looks it up in a table to see where to send the
frame.
For Ethernet, this address is the 48-bit destination address shown in
Fig. 4-14. The bridge only outputs the frame on the port where it is needed and
can forward multiple frames at the same time.
Bridges offer much better performance than hubs, and the isolation between
bridge ports also means that the input lines may run at different speeds, possibly
even with different network types. A common example is a bridge with ports that
connect to 10-, 100-, and 1000-Mbps Ethernet. Buffering within the bridge is
needed to accept a frame on one port and transmit the frame out on a different
port. If frames come in faster than they can be retransmitted, the bridge may run
out of buffer space and have to start discarding frames. For example, if a gigabit
Ethernet is pouring bits into a 10-Mbps Ethernet at top speed, the bridge will have
to buffer them, hoping not to run out of memory. This problem still exists even if
all the ports run at the same speed because more than one port may be sending
frames to a given destination port.
Bridges were originally intended to be able to join different kinds of LANs,
for example, an Ethernet and a Token Ring LAN. However, this never worked
well because of differences between the LANs. Different frame formats require
copying and reformatting, which takes CPU time, requires a new checksum calcu-
lation, and introduces the possibility of undetected errors due to bad bits in the
bridge’s memory. Different maximum frame lengths are also a serious problem
with no good solution. Basically, frames that are too large to be forwarded must
be discarded. So much for transparency.
Two other areas where LANs can differ are security and quality of service.
Some LANs have link-layer encryption, for example 802.11, and some do not, for
example Ethernet. Some LANs have quality of service features such as priorities,
for example 802.11, and some do not, for example Ethernet. Consequently, when

---

## Page 86

342
THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER
CHAP. 4
a frame must travel between these LANs, the security or quality of service expect-
ed by the sender may not be able to be provided. For all of these reasons, modern
bridges usually work for one network type, and routers, which we will come to
soon, are used instead to join networks of different types.
Switches are modern bridges by another name. The differences are more to
do with marketing than technical issues, but there are a few points worth knowing.
Bridges were developed when classic Ethernet was in use, so they tend to join rel-
atively few LANs and thus have relatively few ports. The term ‘‘switch’’ is more
popular nowadays. Also, modern installations all use point-to-point links, such as
twisted-pair cables, so individual computers plug directly into a switch and thus
the switch will tend to have many ports. Finally, ‘‘switch’’ is also used as a gen-
eral term. With a bridge, the functionality is clear. On the other hand, a switch
may refer to an Ethernet switch or a completely different kind of device that
makes forwarding decisions, such as a telephone switch.
So far, we have seen repeaters and hubs, which are actually quite similar, as
well as bridges and switches, which are even more similar to each other. Now we
move up to routers, which are different from all of the above. When a packet
comes into a router, the frame header and trailer are stripped off and the packet lo-
cated in the frame’s payload field (shaded in Fig. 4-45) is passed to the routing
software. This software uses the packet header to choose an output line. For an
IP packet, the packet header will contain a 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) address,
but not a 48-bit IEEE 802 address. The routing software does not see the frame
addresses and does not even know whether the packet came in on a LAN or a
point-to-point line. We will study routers and routing in Chap. 5.
Up another layer, we find transport gateways. These connect two computers
that use different connection-oriented transport protocols. For example, suppose a
computer using the connection-oriented TCP/IP protocol needs to talk to a com-
puter using a different connection-oriented transport protocol called SCTP. The
transport gateway can copy the packets from one connection to the other, refor-
matting them as need be.
Finally, application gateways understand the format and contents of the data
and can translate messages from one format to another. An email gateway could
translate Internet messages into SMS messages for mobile phones, for example.
Like ‘‘switch,’’ ‘‘gateway’’ is somewhat of a general term. It refers to a for-
warding process that runs at a high layer.
4.8.5 Virtual LANs
In the early days of local area networking, thick yellow cables snaked through
the cable ducts of many office buildings.
Every computer they passed was
plugged in. No thought was given to which computer belonged on which LAN.
All the people in adjacent offices were put on the same LAN, whether they be-
longed together or not. Geography trumped corporate organization charts.

With the advent of twisted pair and hubs in the 1990s, all that changed.
Buildings were rewired (at considerable expense) to rip out all the yellow garden
hoses and install twisted pairs from every office to central wiring closets at the
end of each corridor or in a central machine room, as illustrated in Fig. 4-46. If
the Vice President in Charge of Wiring was a visionary, Category 5 twisted pairs
were installed; if he was a bean counter, the existing (Category 3) telephone wir-
ing was used (only to be replaced a few years later, when fast Ethernet emerged).

Figure 4-46. A building with centralized wiring using hubs and a switch.
Today, the cables have changed and hubs have become switches, but the wir-
ing pattern is still the same. This pattern makes it possible to configure LANs
logically rather than physically. For example, if a company wants k LANs, it
could buy k switches. By carefully choosing which connectors to plug into which
switches, the occupants of a LAN can be chosen in a way that makes organiza-
tional sense, without too much regard to geography.
Does it matter who is on which LAN? After all, in nearly all organizations,
all the LANs are interconnected. In short, yes, it often matters. Network adminis-
trators like to group users on LANs to reflect the organizational structure rather
than the physical layout of the building, for a variety of reasons. One issue is se-
curity. One LAN might host Web servers and other computers intended for public
use. Another LAN might host computers containing the records of the Human Re-
sources department that are not to be passed outside of the department. In such a
situation, putting all the computers on a single LAN and not letting any of the ser-
vers be accessed from off the LAN makes sense. Management tends to frown
when hearing that such an arrangement is impossible.

---

## Page 88

344
THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER
CHAP. 4
A second issue is load. Some LANs are more heavily used than others and it
may be desirable to separate them. For example, if the folks in research are run-
ning all kinds of nifty experiments that sometimes get out of hand and saturate
their LAN, the folks in management may not be enthusiastic about donating some
of the capacity they were using for videoconferencing to help out. Then again,
this might impress on management the need to install a faster network.
A third issue is broadcast traffic. Bridges broadcast traffic when the location
of the destination is unknown, and upper-layer protocols use broadcasting as well.
For example, when a user wants to send a packet to an IP address x, how does it
know which MAC address to put in the frame? We will study this question in
Chap. 5, but briefly summarized, the answer is that it broadcasts a frame con-
taining the question ‘‘who owns IP address x?’’ Then it waits for an answer. As
the number of computers in a LAN grows, so does the number of broadcasts. Each
broadcast consumes more of the LAN capacity than a regular frame because it is
delivered to every computer on the LAN. By keeping LANs no larger than they
need to be, the impact of broadcast traffic is reduced.
Related to broadcasts is the problem that once in a while a network interface
will break down or be misconfigured and begin generating an endless stream of
broadcast frames. If the network is really unlucky, some of these frames will elicit
responses that lead to ever more traffic. The result of this broadcast storm is that
(1) the entire LAN capacity is occupied by these frames, and (2) all the machines
on all the interconnected LANs are crippled just processing and discarding all the
frames being broadcast.
At first it might appear that broadcast storms could be limited in scope by
separating the LANs with bridges or switches, but if the goal is to achieve tran-
sparency (i.e., a machine can be moved to a different LAN across the bridge with-
out anyone noticing it), then bridges have to forward broadcast frames.
Having seen why companies might want multiple LANs with restricted
scopes, let us get back to the problem of decoupling the logical topology from the
physical topology. Building a physical topology to reflect the organizational
structure can add work and cost, even with centralized wiring and switches. For
example, if two people in the same department work in different buildings, it may
be easier to wire them to different switches that are part of different LANs. Even
if this is not the case, a user might be shifted within the company from one depart-
ment to another without changing offices, or might change offices without chang-
ing departments. This might result in the user being on the wrong LAN until an
administrator changes the user’s connector from one switch to another. Fur-
thermore, the number of computers that belong to different departments may not
be a good match for the number of ports on switches; some departments may be
too small and others so big that they require multiple switches. This results in
wasted switch ports that are not used.
In many companies, organizational changes occur all the time, meaning that
system administrators spend a lot of time pulling out plugs and pushing them back

in somewhere else. Also, in some cases, the change cannot be made at all be-
cause the twisted pair from the user’s machine is too far from the correct switch
(e.g., in the wrong building), or the available switch ports are on the wrong LAN.
In response to customer requests for more flexibility, network vendors began
working on a way to rewire buildings entirely in software. The resulting concept
is called a VLAN (Virtual LAN). It has been standardized by the IEEE 802
committee and is now widely deployed in many organizations. Let us now take a
look at it. For additional information about VLANs, see Seifert and Edwards
(2008).
VLANs are based on VLAN-aware switches. To set up a VLAN-based net-
work, the network administrator decides how many VLANs there will be, which
computers will be on which VLAN, and what the VLANs will be called. Often
the VLANs are (informally) named by colors, since it is then possible to print
color diagrams showing the physical layout of the machines, with the members of
the red LAN in red, members of the green LAN in green, and so on. In this way,
both the physical and logical layouts are visible in a single view.
As an example, consider the bridged LAN of Fig. 4-47, in which nine of the
machines belong to the G (gray) VLAN and five belong to the W (white) VLAN.
Machines from the gray VLAN are spread across two switches, including two ma-
chines that connect to a switch via a hub.

Figure 4-47. Two VLANs, gray and white, on a bridged LAN.
To make the VLANs function correctly, configuration tables have to be set up
in the bridges. These tables tell which VLANs are accessible via which ports.
When a frame comes in from, say, the gray VLAN, it must be forwarded on all
the ports marked with a G. This holds for ordinary (i.e., unicast) traffic for which
the bridges have not learned the location of the destination, as well as for multi-
cast and broadcast traffic. Note that a port may be labeled with multiple VLAN
colors.
As an example, suppose that one of the gray stations plugged into bridge B1 in
Fig. 4-47 sends a frame to a destination that has not been observed beforehand.
Bridge B1 will receive the frame and see that it came from a machine on the gray

VLAN, so it will flood the frame on all ports labeled G (except the incoming
port). The frame will be sent to the five other gray stations attached to B1 as well
as over the link from B1 to bridge B2. At bridge B2, the frame is similarly for-
warded on all ports labeled G. This sends the frame to one further station and the
hub (which will transmit the frame to all of its stations). The hub has both labels
because it connects to machines from both VLANs. The frame is not sent on
other ports without G in the label because the bridge knows that there are no ma-
chines on the gray VLAN that can be reached via these ports.
In our example, the frame is only sent from bridge B1 to bridge B2 because
there are machines on the gray VLAN that are connected to B2. Looking at the
white VLAN, we can see that the bridge B2 port that connects to bridge B1 is not
labeled W. This means that a frame on the white VLAN will not be forwarded
from bridge B2 to bridge B1. This behavior is correct because no stations on the
white VLAN are connected to B1.
The IEEE 802.1Q Standard
To implement this scheme, bridges need to know to which VLAN an incom-
ing frame belongs. Without this information, for example, when bridge B2 gets a
frame from bridge B1 in Fig. 4-47, it cannot know whether to forward the frame
on the gray or white VLAN. If we were designing a new type of LAN, it would
be easy enough to just add a VLAN field in the header. But what to do about
Ethernet, which is the dominant LAN, and did not have any spare fields lying
around for the VLAN identifier?
The IEEE 802 committee had this problem thrown into its lap in 1995. After
much discussion, it did the unthinkable and changed the Ethernet header. The
new format was published in IEEE standard 802.1Q, issued in 1998. The new
format contains a VLAN tag; we will examine it shortly. Not surprisingly, chang-
ing something as well established as the Ethernet header was not entirely trivial.
A few questions that come to mind are:
1. Need we throw out several hundred million existing Ethernet cards?
2. If not, who generates the new fields?
3. What happens to frames that are already the maximum size?
Of course, the 802 committee was (only too painfully) aware of these problems
and had to come up with solutions, which it did.
The key to the solution is to realize that the VLAN fields are only actually
used by the bridges and switches and not by the user machines. Thus, in Fig. 4-
47, it is not really essential that they are present on the lines going out to the end
stations as long as they are on the line between the bridges. Also, to use VLANs,
the bridges have to be VLAN aware. This fact makes the design feasible.

As to throwing out all existing Ethernet cards, the answer is no. Remember
that the 802.3 committee could not even get people to change the Type field into a
Length field. You can imagine the reaction to an announcement that all existing
Ethernet cards had to be thrown out. However, new Ethernet cards are 802.1Q
compliant and can correctly fill in the VLAN fields.
Because there can be computers (and switches) that are not VLAN aware, the
first VLAN-aware bridge to touch a frame adds VLAN fields and the last one
down the road removes them. An example of a mixed topology is shown in
Fig. 4-48. In this figure, VLAN-aware computers generate tagged (i.e., 802.1Q)
frames directly, and further switching uses these tags. The shaded symbols are
VLAN-aware and the empty ones are not.

Figure 4-48. Bridged LAN that is only partly VLAN aware. The shaded symb-
ols are VLAN aware. The empty ones are not.
With 802.1Q, frames are colored depending on the port on which they are re-
ceived. For this method to work, all machines on a port must belong to the same
VLAN, which reduces flexibility. For example, in Fig. 4-48, this property holds
for all ports where an individual computer connects to a bridge, but not for the
port where the hub connects to bridge B2.
Additionally, the bridge can use the higher-layer protocol to select the color.
In this way, frames arriving on a port might be placed in different VLANs de-
pending on whether they carry IP packets or PPP frames.
Other methods are possible, but they are not supported by 802.1Q. As one ex-
ample, the MAC address can be used to select the VLAN color. This might be
useful for frames coming in from a nearby 802.11 LAN in which laptops send
frames via different ports as they move. One MAC address would then be mapped
to a fixed VLAN regardless of which port it entered the LAN on.
As to the problem of frames longer than 1518 bytes, 802.1Q just raised the
limit to 1522 bytes. Luckily, only VLAN-aware computers and switches must
support these longer frames.
Now let us take a look at the 802.1Q frame format. It is shown in Fig. 4-49.
The only change is the addition of a pair of 2-byte fields. The first one is the

VLAN protocol ID. It always has the value 0x8100. Since this number is greater
than 1500, all Ethernet cards interpret it as a type rather than a length. What a
legacy card does with such a frame is moot since such frames are not supposed to
be sent to legacy cards.

The second 2-byte field contains three subfields. The main one is the VLAN
identifier, occupying the low-order 12 bits. This is what the whole thing is
about—the color of the VLAN to which the frame belongs. The 3-bit Priority
field has nothing to do with VLANs at all, but since changing the Ethernet header
is a once-in-a-decade event taking three years and featuring a hundred people,
why not put in some other good things while you are at it? This field makes it
possible to distinguish hard real-time traffic from soft real-time traffic from time-
insensitive traffic in order to provide better quality of service over Ethernet. It is
needed for voice over Ethernet (although in all fairness, IP has had a similar field
for a quarter of a century and nobody ever used it).
The last field, CFI (Canonical format indicator), should have been called the
CEI (Corporate ego indicator). It was originally intended to indicate the order of
the bits in the MAC addresses (little-endian versus big-endian), but that use got
lost in other controversies. Its presence now indicates that the payload contains a
freeze-dried 802.5 frame that is hoping to find another 802.5 LAN at the destina-
tion while being carried by Ethernet in between. This whole arrangement, of
course, has nothing whatsoever to do with VLANs. But standards’ committee
politics are not unlike regular politics: if you vote for my bit, I will vote for your
bit.
As we mentioned above, when a tagged frame arrives at a VLAN-aware
switch, the switch uses the VLAN identifier as an index into a table to find out
which ports to send it on. But where does the table come from? If it is manually
constructed, we are back to square zero: manual configuration of bridges. The
beauty of the transparent bridge is that it is plug-and-play and does not require any
manual configuration. It would be a terrible shame to lose that property. For-
tunately, VLAN-aware bridges can also autoconfigure themselves based on
observing the tags that come by. If a frame tagged as VLAN 4 comes in on port

3, apparently some machine on port 3 is on VLAN 4. The 802.1Q standard ex-
plains how to build the tables dynamically, mostly by referencing appropriate por-
tions of the 802.1D standard.
Before leaving the subject of VLAN routing, it is worth making one last
observation. Many people in the Internet and Ethernet worlds are fanatically in
favor of connectionless networking and violently opposed to anything smacking
of connections in the data link or network layers. Yet VLANs introduce some-
thing that is surprisingly similar to a connection. To use VLANs properly, each
frame carries a new special identifier that is used as an index into a table inside
the switch to look up where the frame is supposed to be sent. That is precisely
what happens in connection-oriented networks. In connectionless networks, it is
the destination address that is used for routing, not some kind of connection iden-
tifier. We will see more of this creeping connectionism in Chap. 5.
4.9 SUMMARY
Some networks have a single channel that is used for all communication. In
these networks, the key design issue is the allocation of this channel among the
competing stations wishing to use it. FDM and TDM are simple, efficient alloca-
tion schemes when the number of stations is small and fixed and the traffic is con-
tinuous. Both are widely used under these circumstances, for example, for divid-
ing up the bandwidth on telephone trunks. However, when the number of stations
is large and variable or the traffic is fairly bursty—the common case in computer
networks—FDM and TDM are poor choices.
Numerous dynamic channel allocation algorithms have been devised. The
ALOHA protocol, with and without slotting, is used in many derivatives in real
systems, for example, cable modems and RFID. As an improvement when the
state of the channel can be sensed, stations can avoid starting a transmission while
another station is transmitting. This technique, carrier sensing, has led to a variety
of CSMA protocols for LANs and MANs. It is the basis for classic Ethernet and
802.11 networks.
A class of protocols that eliminates contention altogether, or at least reduces it
considerably, is well known. The bitmap protocol, topologies such as rings, and
the binary countdown protocol completely eliminate contention. The tree walk
protocol reduces it by dynamically dividing the stations into two disjoint groups of
different sizes and allowing contention only within one group; ideally that group
is chosen so that only one station is ready to send when it is permitted to do so.
Wireless LANs have the added problems that it is difficult to sense colliding
transmissions, and that the coverage regions of stations may differ. In the dom-
inant wireless LAN, IEEE 802.11, stations use CSMA/CA to mitigate the first
problem by leaving small gaps to avoid collisions. The stations can also use the
RTS/CTS protocol to combat hidden terminals that arise because of the second

problem. IEEE 802.11 is commonly used to connect laptops and other devices to
wireless access points, but it can also be used between devices. Any of several
physical layers can be used, including multichannel FDM with and without multi-
ple antennas, and spread spectrum.
Like 802.11, RFID readers and tags use a random access protocol to commun-
icate identifiers. Other wireless PANs and MANs have different designs. The
Bluetooth system connects headsets and many kinds of peripherals to computers
without wires. IEEE 802.16 provides a wide area wireless Internet data service
for stationary and mobile computers. Both of these networks use a centralized,
connection-oriented design in which the Bluetooth master and the WiMAX base
station decide when each station may send or receive data. For 802.16, this design
supports different quality of service for real-time traffic like telephone calls and
interactive traffic like Web browsing. For Bluetooth, placing the complexity in
the master leads to inexpensive slave devices.
Ethernet is the dominant form of wired LAN.
Classic Ethernet used
CSMA/CD for channel allocation on a yellow cable the size of a garden hose that
snaked from machine to machine. The architecture has changed as speeds have
risen from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps and continue to climb. Now, point-to-point links
such as twisted pair are attached to hubs and switches. With modern switches and
full-duplex links, there is no contention on the links and the switch can forward
frames between different ports in parallel.
With buildings full of LANs, a way is needed to interconnect them all. Plug-
and-play bridges are used for this purpose. The bridges are built with a backward
learning algorithm and a spanning tree algorithm. Since this functionality is built
into modern switches, the terms ‘‘bridge’’ and ‘‘switch’’ are used interchangeably.
To help with the management of bridged LANs, VLANs let the physical topology
be divided into different logical topologies. The VLAN standard, IEEE 802.1Q,
introduces a new format for Ethernet frames.
PROBLEMS
1. For this problem, use a formula from this chapter, but first state the formula. Frames
arrive randomly at a 100-Mbps channel for transmission. If the channel is busy when
a frame arrives, it waits its turn in a queue. Frame length is exponentially distributed
with a mean of 10,000 bits/frame. For each of the following frame arrival rates, give
the delay experienced by the average frame, including both queueing time and trans-
mission time.
(a) 90 frames/sec.
(b) 900 frames/sec.
(c) 9000 frames/sec.

ferent from 802.11.
29. From Fig. 4-34, we see that a Bluetooth device can be in two piconets at the same

switch. Would it be possible to use a legacy switch there? If so, how would that
work? If not, why not?
43. Write a program to simulate the behavior of the CSMA/CD protocol over Ethernet
when there are N stations ready to transmit while a frame is being transmitted. Your
program should report the times when each station successfully starts sending its

ion detection and sending of a jamming sequence takes one slot time. All frames are
the maximum length allowed.
