THE APPLICATION LAYER
Having finished all the preliminaries, we now come to the layer where all the
applications are found. The layers below the application layer are there to provide
transport services, but they do not do real work for users. In this chapter, we will
study some real network applications.
However, even in the application layer there is a need for support protocols, to
allow the applications to function. Accordingly, we will look at an important one
of these before starting with the applications themselves. The item in question is
DNS, which handles naming within the Internet. After that, we will examine
three real applications: electronic mail, the World Wide Web, and multimedia.
We will finish the chapter by saying more about content distribution, including by
peer-to-peer networks.
7.1 DNS—THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM
Although programs theoretically could refer to Web pages, mailboxes, and
other resources by using the network (e.g., IP) addresses of the computers on
which they are stored, these addresses are hard for people to remember. Also,
browsing a company’s Web pages from 128.111.24.41 means that if the company
moves the Web server to a different machine with a different IP address, everyone
needs to be told the new IP address. Consequently, high-level, readable names
were introduced in order to decouple machine names from machine addresses. In

this way, the company’s Web server might be known as www.cs.washington.edu
regardless of its IP address. Nevertheless, since the network itself understands
only numerical addresses, some mechanism is required to convert the names to
network addresses. In the following sections, we will study how this mapping is
accomplished in the Internet.
Way back in the ARPANET days, there was simply a file, hosts.txt, that listed
all the computer names and their IP addresses. Every night, all the hosts would
fetch it from the site at which it was maintained. For a network of a few hundred
large timesharing machines, this approach worked reasonably well.
However, well before many millions of PCs were connected to the Internet,
everyone involved with it realized that this approach could not continue to work
forever. For one thing, the size of the file would become too large. However,
even more importantly, host name conflicts would occur constantly unless names
were centrally managed, something unthinkable in a huge international network
due to the load and latency. To solve these problems, DNS (Domain Name Sys-
tem) was invented in 1983. It has been a key part of the Internet ever since.
The essence of DNS is the invention of a hierarchical, domain-based naming
scheme and a distributed database system for implementing this naming scheme.
It is primarily used for mapping host names to IP addresses but can also be used
for other purposes. DNS is defined in RFCs 1034, 1035, 2181, and further ela-
borated in many others.
Very briefly, the way DNS is used is as follows. To map a name onto an IP
address, an application program calls a library procedure called the resolver, pas-
sing it the name as a parameter. We saw an example of a resolver, gethost-
byname, in Fig. 6-6. The resolver sends a query containing the name to a local
DNS server, which looks up the name and returns a response containing the IP ad-
dress to the resolver, which then returns it to the caller. The query and response
messages are sent as UDP packets. Armed with the IP address, the program can
then establish a TCP connection with the host or send it UDP packets.
7.1.1 The DNS Name Space
Managing a large and constantly changing set of names is a nontrivial prob-
lem. In the postal system, name management is done by requiring letters to speci-
fy (implicitly or explicitly) the country, state or province, city, street address, and
name of the addressee. Using this kind of hierarchical addressing ensures that
there is no confusion between the Marvin Anderson on Main St. in White Plains,
N.Y. and the Marvin Anderson on Main St. in Austin, Texas. DNS works the
same way.
For the Internet, the top of the naming hierarchy is managed by an organiza-
tion called ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
ICANN was created for this purpose in 1998, as part of the maturing of the Inter-
net to a worldwide, economic concern. Conceptually, the Internet is divided into

over 250 top-level domains, where each domain covers many hosts. Each do-
main is partitioned into subdomains, and these are further partitioned, and so on.
All these domains can be represented by a tree, as shown in Fig. 7-1. The leaves
of the tree represent domains that have no subdomains (but do contain machines,
of course). A leaf domain may contain a single host, or it may represent a com-
pany and contain thousands of hosts.

Figure 7-1. A portion of the Internet domain name space.
The top-level domains come in two flavors: generic and countries. The gen-
eric domains, listed in Fig. 7-2, include original domains from the 1980s and do-
mains introduced via applications to ICANN. Other generic top-level domains
will be added in the future.
The country domains include one entry for every country, as defined in ISO
3166. Internationalized country domain names that use non-Latin alphabets were
introduced in 2010. These domains let people name hosts in Arabic, Cyrillic,
Chinese, or other languages.
Getting a second-level domain, such as name-of-company.com, is easy. The
top-level domains are run by registrars appointed by ICANN. Getting a name
merely requires going to a corresponding registrar (for com in this case) to check
if the desired name is available and not somebody else’s trademark. If there are
no problems, the requester pays the registrar a small annual fee and gets the name.
However, as the Internet has become more commercial and more internation-
al, it has also become more contentious, especially in matters related to naming.
This controversy includes ICANN itself. For example, the creation of the xxx do-
main took several years and court cases to resolve. Is voluntarily placing adult
content in its own domain a good or a bad thing? (Some people did not want adult
content available at all on the Internet while others wanted to put it all in one do-
main so nanny filters could easily find and block it from children). Some of the
domains self-organize, while others have restrictions on who can obtain a name,
as noted in Fig. 7-2. But what restrictions are appropriate? Take the pro domain,

for example. It is for qualified professionals. But who is a professional? Doctors
and lawyers clearly are professionals. But what about freelance photographers,
piano teachers, magicians, plumbers, barbers, exterminators, tattoo artists, mer-
cenaries, and prostitutes? Are these occupations eligible? According to whom?
There is also money in names. Tuvalu (the country) sold a lease on its tv do-
main for $50 million, all because the country code is well-suited to advertising
television sites. Virtually every common (English) word has been taken in the
com domain, along with the most common misspellings. Try household articles,
animals, plants, body parts, etc. The practice of registering a domain only to turn
around and sell it off to an interested party at a much higher price even has a
name. It is called cybersquatting. Many companies that were slow off the mark
when the Internet era began found their obvious domain names already taken
when they tried to acquire them. In general, as long as no trademarks are being
violated and no fraud is involved, it is first-come, first-served with names. Never-
theless, policies to resolve naming disputes are still being refined.

Each domain is named by the path upward from it to the (unnamed) root. The
components are separated by periods (pronounced ‘‘dot’’). Thus, the engineering
department at Cisco might be eng.cisco.com., rather than a UNIX-style name such
as /com/cisco/eng. Notice that this hierarchical naming means that eng.cisco.com.
does not conflict with a potential use of eng in eng.washington.edu., which might
be used by the English department at the University of Washington.
Domain names can be either absolute or relative. An absolute domain name
always ends with a period (e.g., eng.cisco.com.), whereas a relative one does not.
Relative names have to be interpreted in some context to uniquely determine their
true meaning. In both cases, a named domain refers to a specific node in the tree
and all the nodes under it.
Domain names are case-insensitive, so edu, Edu, and EDU mean the same
thing. Component names can be up to 63 characters long, and full path names
must not exceed 255 characters.
In principle, domains can be inserted into the tree in either generic or country
domains. For example, cs.washington.edu could equally well be listed under the
us country domain as cs.washington.wa.us. In practice, however, most organiza-
tions in the United States are under generic domains, and most outside the United
States are under the domain of their country. There is no rule against registering
under multiple top-level domains. Large companies often do so (e.g., sony.com,
sony.net, and sony.nl).
Each domain controls how it allocates the domains under it. For example,
Japan has domains ac.jp and co.jp that mirror edu and com. The Netherlands does
not make this distinction and puts all organizations directly under nl. Thus, all
three of the following are university computer science departments:
1. cs.washington.edu (University of Washington, in the U.S.).
2. cs.vu.nl (Vrije Universiteit, in The Netherlands).
3. cs.keio.ac.jp (Keio University, in Japan).
To create a new domain, permission is required of the domain in which it will
be included. For example, if a VLSI group is started at the University of Wash-
ington and wants to be known as vlsi.cs.washington.edu, it has to get permission
from whoever manages cs.washington.edu. Similarly, if a new university is char-
tered, say, the University of Northern South Dakota, it must ask the manager of
the edu domain to assign it unsd.edu (if that is still available). In this way, name
conflicts are avoided and each domain can keep track of all its subdomains. Once
a new domain has been created and registered, it can create subdomains, such as
cs.unsd.edu, without getting permission from anybody higher up the tree.
Naming follows organizational boundaries, not physical networks. For ex-
ample, if the computer science and electrical engineering departments are located
in the same building and share the same LAN, they can nevertheless have distinct

---

domains. Similarly, even if computer science is split over Babbage Hall and Tur-
ing Hall, the hosts in both buildings will normally belong to the same domain.
7.1.2 Domain Resource Records
Every domain, whether it is a single host or a top-level domain, can have a set
of resource records associated with it. These records are the DNS database. For
a single host, the most common resource record is just its IP address, but many
other kinds of resource records also exist. When a resolver gives a domain name
to DNS, what it gets back are the resource records associated with that
name. Thus, the primary function of DNS is to map domain names onto resource
records.
A resource record is a five-tuple. Although they are encoded in binary for ef-
ficiency, in most expositions resource records are presented as ASCII text, one
line per resource record. The format we will use is as follows:
Domain name
Time to live
Class
Type
Value
The Domain name tells the domain to which this record applies. Normally, many
records exist for each domain and each copy of the database holds information
about multiple domains. This field is thus the primary search key used to satisfy
queries. The order of the records in the database is not significant.
The Time to live field gives an indication of how stable the record is. Infor-
mation that is highly stable is assigned a large value, such as 86400 (the number
of seconds in 1 day). Information that is highly volatile is assigned a small value,
such as 60 (1 minute). We will come back to this point later when we have dis-
cussed caching.
The third field of every resource record is the Class. For Internet information,
it is always IN. For non-Internet information, other codes can be used, but in
practice these are rarely seen.
The Type field tells what kind of record this is. There are many kinds of DNS
records. The important types are listed in Fig. 7-3.
An SOA record provides the name of the primary source of information about
the name server’s zone (described below), the email address of its administrator, a
unique serial number, and various flags and timeouts.
The most important record type is the A (Address) record. It holds a 32-bit
IPv4 address of an interface for some host. The corresponding AAAA, or ‘‘quad
A,’’ record holds a 128-bit IPv6 address. Every Internet host must have at least
one IP address so that other machines can communicate with it. Some hosts have
two or more network interfaces, in which case they will have two or more type A
or AAAA resource records. Consequently, DNS can return multiple addresses for
a single name.
A common record type is the MX record. It specifies the name of the host
prepared to accept email for the specified domain. It is used because not every

machine is prepared to accept email. If someone wants to send email to, for ex-
ample, bill@microsoft.com, the sending host needs to find some mail server loca-
ted at microsoft.com that is willing to accept email. The MX record can provide
this information.
Another important record type is the NS record. It specifies a name server for
the domain or subdomain. This is a host that has a copy of the database for a do-
main. It is used as part of the process to look up names, which we will describe
shortly.
CNAME records allow aliases to be created. For example, a person familiar
with Internet naming in general and wanting to send a message to user paul in the
computer science department at M.I.T. might guess that paul@cs.mit.edu will
work. Actually, this address will not work, because the domain for M.I.T.’s com-
puter science department is csail.mit.edu. However, as a service to people who do
not know this, M.I.T. could create a CNAME entry to point people and programs
in the right direction. An entry like this one might do the job:
cs.mit.edu
86400
IN
CNAME
csail.mit.edu
Like CNAME, PTR points to another name. However, unlike CNAME, which
is really just a macro definition (i.e., a mechanism to replace one string by anoth-
er), PTR is a regular DNS data type whose interpretation depends on the context
in which it is found. In practice, it is nearly always used to associate a name with
an IP address to allow lookups of the IP address and return the name of the corres-
ponding machine. These are called reverse lookups.
SRV is a newer type of record that allows a host to be identified for a given
service in a domain. For example, the Web server for cs.washington.edu could be
identified as cockatoo.cs.washington.edu. This record generalizes the MX record
that performs the same task but it is just for mail servers.

---

## Page 8

THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
SPF is also a newer type of record. It lets a domain encode information about
what machines in the domain will send mail to the rest of the Internet. This helps
receiving machines check that mail is valid. If mail is being received from a ma-
chine that calls itself dodgy but the domain records say that mail will only be sent
out of the domain by a machine called smtp, chances are that the mail is forged
junk mail.
Last on the list, TXT records were originally provided to allow domains to
identify themselves in arbitrary ways. Nowadays, they usually encode machine-
readable information, typically the SPF information.
Finally, we have the Value field. This field can be a number, a domain name,
or an ASCII string. The semantics depend on the record type. A short description
of the Value fields for each of the principal record types is given in Fig. 7-3.
For an example of the kind of information one might find in the DNS database
of a domain, see Fig. 7-4. This figure depicts part of a (hypothetical) database for
the cs.vu.nl domain shown in Fig. 7-1. The database contains seven types of re-
source records.

and second places to try to deliver email sent to person@cs.vu.nl. The zephyr (a
specific machine) should be tried first. If that fails, the top should be tried as the
next choice. The next line identifies the name server for the domain as star.
After the blank line (added for readability) come lines giving the IP addresses
for the star, zephyr, and top. These are followed by an alias, www.cs.vu.nl, so that
this address can be used without designating a specific machine. Creating this
alias allows cs.vu.nl to change its World Wide Web server without invalidating
the address people use to get to it. A similar argument holds for ftp.cs.vu.nl.
The section for the machine flits lists two IP addresses and three choices are
given for handling email sent to flits.cs.vu.nl. First choice is naturally the flits it-
self, but if it is down, the zephyr and top are the second and third choices.
The next three lines contain a typical entry for a computer, in this case,
rowboat.cs.vu.nl. The information provided contains the IP address and the pri-
mary and secondary mail drops. Then comes an entry for a computer that is not
capable of receiving mail itself, followed by an entry that is likely for a printer
that is connected to the Internet.
7.1.3 Name Servers
In theory at least, a single name server could contain the entire DNS database
and respond to all queries about it. In practice, this server would be so overloaded
as to be useless. Furthermore, if it ever went down, the entire Internet would be
crippled.
To avoid the problems associated with having only a single source of infor-
mation, the DNS name space is divided into nonoverlapping zones. One possible
way to divide the name space of Fig. 7-1 is shown in Fig. 7-5. Each circled zone
contains some part of the tree.

CHAP. 7
Where the zone boundaries are placed within a zone is up to that zone’s ad-
ministrator. This decision is made in large part based on how many name servers
are desired, and where. For example, in Fig. 7-5, the University of Washington
has a zone for washington.edu that handles eng.washington.edu but does not han-
dle cs.washington.edu. That is a separate zone with its own name servers. Such a
decision might be made when a department such as English does not wish to run
its own name server, but a department such as Computer Science does.
Each zone is also associated with one or more name servers. These are hosts
that hold the database for the zone. Normally, a zone will have one primary name
server, which gets its information from a file on its disk, and one or more sec-
ondary name servers, which get their information from the primary name server.
To improve reliability, some of the name servers can be located outside the zone.
The process of looking up a name and finding an address is called name reso-
lution. When a resolver has a query about a domain name, it passes the query to a
local name server. If the domain being sought falls under the jurisdiction of the
name server, such as top.cs.vu.nl falling under cs.vu.nl, it returns the authoritative
resource records. An authoritative record is one that comes from the authority
that manages the record and is thus always correct. Authoritative records are in
contrast to cached records, which may be out of date.
What happens when the domain is remote, such as when flits.cs.vu.nl wants to
find the IP address of robot.cs.washington.edu at UW (University of Washing-
ton)? In this case, and if there is no cached information about the domain avail-
able locally, the name server begins a remote query. This query follows the proc-
ess shown in Fig. 7-6. Step 1 shows the query that is sent to the local name ser-
ver. The query contains the domain name sought, the type (A), and the class(IN).

domain. This is shown as step 2 in Fig. 7-6. To contact a root server, each name
server must have information about one or more root name servers. This infor-
mation is normally present in a system configuration file that is loaded into the
DNS cache when the DNS server is started. It is simply a list of NS records for the
root and the corresponding A records.
There are 13 root DNS servers, unimaginatively called a-root-servers.net
through m.root-servers.net. Each root server could logically be a single computer.
However, since the entire Internet depends on the root servers, they are powerful
and heavily replicated computers. Most of the servers are present in multiple geo-
graphical locations and reached using anycast routing, in which a packet is deliv-
ered to the nearest instance of a destination address; we described anycast in
Chap. 5 The replication improves reliability and performance.
The root name server is unlikely to know the address of a machine at UW,
and probably does not know the name server for UW either. But it must know the
name server for the edu domain, in which cs.washington.edu is located. It returns
the name and IP address for that part of the answer in step 3.
The local name server then continues its quest. It sends the entire query to the
edu name server (a.edu-servers.net). That name server returns the name server
for UW. This is shown in steps 4 and 5. Closer now, the local name server sends
the query to the UW name server (step 6). If the domain name being sought was
in the English department, the answer would be found, as the UW zone includes
the English department. But the Computer Science department has chosen to run
its own name server. The query returns the name and IP address of the UW Com-
puter Science name server (step 7).
Finally, the local name server queries the UW Computer Science name server
(step 8). This server is authoritative for the domain cs.washington.edu, so it must
have the answer. It returns the final answer (step 9), which the local name server
forwards as a response to flits.cs.vu.nl (step 10). The name has been resolved.
You can explore this process using standard tools such as the dig program that
is installed on most UNIX systems. For example, typing
dig@a.edu-servers.net robot.cs.washington.edu
will send a query for robot.cs.washington.edu to the a.edu-servers.net name ser-
ver and print out the result. This will show you the information obtained in step 4
in the example above, and you will learn the name and IP address of the UW
name servers.
There are three technical points to discuss about this long scenario. First, two
different query mechanisms are at work in Fig. 7-6. When the host flits.cs.vu.nl
sends its query to the local name server, that name server handles the resolution
on behalf of flits until it has the desired answer to return. It does not return partial
answers. They might be helpful, but they are not what the query was seeking. This
mechanism is called a recursive query.

---

## Page 12

622
THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
On the other hand, the root name server (and each subsequent name server)
does not recursively continue the query for the local name server. It just returns a
partial answer and moves on to the next query. The local name server is responsi-
ble for continuing the resolution by issuing further queries. This mechanism is
called an iterative query.
One name resolution can involve both mechanisms, as this example showed.
A recursive query may always seem preferable, but many name servers (especial-
ly the root) will not handle them. They are too busy. Iterative queries put the bur-
den on the originator. The rationale for the local name server supporting a recur-
sive query is that it is providing a service to hosts in its domain. Those hosts do
not have to be configured to run a full name server, just to reach the local one.
The second point is caching. All of the answers, including all the partial
answers returned, are cached. In this way, if another cs.vu.nl host queries for
robot.cs.washington.edu the answer will already be known. Even better, if a host
queries for a different host in the same domain, say galah.cs.washington.edu, the
query can be sent directly to the authoritative name server. Similarly, queries for
other domains in washington.edu can start directly from the washington.edu name
server. Using cached answers greatly reduces the steps in a query and improves
performance. The original scenario we sketched is in fact the worst case that oc-
curs when no useful information is cached.
However, cached answers are not authoritative, since changes made at
cs.washington.edu will not be propagated to all the caches in the world that may
know about it. For this reason, cache entries should not live too long. This is the
reason that the Time to live field is included in each resource record. It tells re-
mote name servers how long to cache records. If a certain machine has had the
same IP address for years, it may be safe to cache that information for 1 day. For
more volatile information, it might be safer to purge the records after a few sec-
onds or a minute.
The third issue is the transport protocol that is used for the queries and re-
sponses. It is UDP. DNS messages are sent in UDP packets with a simple format
for queries, answers, and name servers that can be used to continue the resolution.
We will not go into the details of this format. If no response arrives within a short
time, the DNS client repeats the query, trying another server for the domain after
a small number of retries. This process is designed to handle the case of the ser-
ver being down as well as the query or response packet getting lost. A 16-bit
identifier is included in each query and copied to the response so that a name ser-
ver can match answers to the corresponding query, even if multiple queries are
outstanding at the same time.
Even though its purpose is simple, it should be clear that DNS is a large and
complex distributed system that is comprised of millions of name servers that
work together. It forms a key link between human-readable domain names and
the IP addresses of machines. It includes replication and caching for performance
and reliability and is designed to be highly robust.

DNS—THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM

We have not covered security, but as you might imagine, the ability to change
the name-to-address mapping can have devastating consequences if done mali-
ciously. For that reason, security extensions called DNSSEC have been developed
for DNS. We will describe them in Chap. 8.
There is also application demand to use names in more flexible ways, for ex-
ample, by naming content and resolving to the IP address of a nearby host that has
the content. This fits the model of searching for and downloading a movie. It is
the movie that matters, not the computer that has a copy of it, so all that is wanted
is the IP address of any nearby computer that has a copy of the movie. Content
distribution networks are one way to accomplish this mapping. We will describe
how they build on the DNS later in this chapter, in Sec. 7.5.
7.2 ELECTRONIC MAIL
Electronic mail, or more commonly email, has been around for over three
decades. Faster and cheaper than paper mail, email has been a popular applica-
tion since the early days of the Internet. Before 1990, it was mostly used in
academia. During the 1990s, it became known to the public at large and grew
exponentially, to the point where the number of emails sent per day now is vastly
more than the number of snail mail (i.e., paper) letters. Other forms of network
communication, such as instant messaging and voice-over-IP calls have expanded
greatly in use over the past decade, but email remains the workhorse of Internet
communication. It is widely used within industry for intracompany communica-
tion, for example, to allow far-flung employees all over the world to cooperate on
complex projects. Unfortunately, like paper mail, the majority of email—some 9
out of 10 messages—is junk mail or spam (McAfee, 2010).
Email, like most other forms of communication, has developed its own con-
ventions and styles. It is very informal and has a low threshold of use. People
who would never dream of calling up or even writing a letter to a Very Important
Person do not hesitate for a second to send a sloppily written email to him or her.
By eliminating most cues associated with rank, age, and gender, email debates
often focus on content, not status. With email, a brilliant idea from a summer stu-
dent can have more impact than a dumb one from an executive vice president.
Email is full of jargon such as BTW (By The Way), ROTFL (Rolling On The
Floor Laughing), and IMHO (In My Humble Opinion). Many people also use lit-
tle ASCII symbols called smileys, starting with the ubiquitous ‘‘:-)’’. Rotate the
book 90 degrees clockwise if this symbol is unfamiliar. This symbol and other
emoticons help to convey the tone of the message. They have spread to other
terse forms of communication, such as instant messaging.
The email protocols have evolved during the period of their use, too. The first
email systems simply consisted of file transfer protocols, with the convention that
the first line of each message (i.e., file) contained the recipient’s address. As time

went on, email diverged from file transfer and many features were added, such as
the ability to send one message to a list of recipients. Multimedia capabilities
became important in the 1990s to send messages with images and other non-text
material. Programs for reading email became much more sophisticated too, shift-
ing from text-based to graphical user interfaces and adding the ability for users to
access their mail from their laptops wherever they happen to be. Finally, with the
prevalence of spam, mail readers and the mail transfer protocols must now pay
attention to finding and removing unwanted email.
In our description of email, we will focus on the way that mail messages are
moved between users, rather than the look and feel of mail reader programs.
Nevertheless, after describing the overall architecture, we will begin with the
user-facing part of the email system, as it is familiar to most readers.
7.2.1 Architecture and Services
In this section, we will provide an overview of how email systems are organ-
ized and what they can do. The architecture of the email system is shown in
Fig. 7-7. It consists of two kinds of subsystems: the user agents, which allow
people to read and send email, and the message transfer agents, which move the
messages from the source to the destination. We will also refer to message trans-
fer agents informally as mail servers.

Figure 7-7. Architecture of the email system.
The user agent is a program that provides a graphical interface, or sometimes
a text- and command-based interface that lets users interact with the email system.
It includes a means to compose messages and replies to messages, display incom-
ing messages, and organize messages by filing, searching, and discarding them.
The act of sending new messages into the mail system for delivery is called mail
submission.
Some of the user agent processing may be done automatically, anticipating
what the user wants. For example, incoming mail may be filtered to extract or

deprioritize messages that are likely spam. Some user agents include advanced
features, such as arranging for automatic email responses (‘‘I’m having a wonder-
ful vacation and it will be a while before I get back to you’’). A user agent runs
on the same computer on which a user reads her mail. It is just another program
and may be run only some of the time.
The message transfer agents are typically system processes. They run in the
background on mail server machines and are intended to be always available.
Their job is to automatically move email through the system from the originator to
the recipient with SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This is the message
transfer step.
SMTP was originally specified as RFC 821 and revised to become the current
RFC 5321. It sends mail over connections and reports back the delivery status
and any errors. Numerous applications exist in which confirmation of delivery is
important and may even have legal significance (‘‘Well, Your Honor, my email
system is just not very reliable, so I guess the electronic subpoena just got lost
somewhere’’).
Message transfer agents also implement mailing lists, in which an identical
copy of a message is delivered to everyone on a list of email addresses. Other ad-
vanced features are carbon copies, blind carbon copies, high-priority email, secret
(i.e., encrypted) email, alternative recipients if the primary one is not currently
available, and the ability for assistants to read and answer their bosses’ email.
Linking user agents and message transfer agents are the concepts of mail-
boxes and a standard format for email messages. Mailboxes store the email that
is received for a user. They are maintained by mail servers. User agents simply
present users with a view of the contents of their mailboxes. To do this, the user
agents send the mail servers commands to manipulate the mailboxes, inspecting
their contents, deleting messages, and so on. The retrieval of mail is the final de-
livery (step 3) in Fig. 7-7. With this architecture, one user may use different user
agents on multiple computers to access one mailbox.
Mail is sent between message transfer agents in a standard format. The origi-
nal format, RFC 822, has been revised to the current RFC 5322 and extended with
support for multimedia content and international text. This scheme is called
MIME and will be discussed later. People still refer to Internet email as RFC 822,
though.
A key idea in the message format is the distinction between the envelope and
its contents. The envelope encapsulates the message. It contains all the infor-
mation needed for transporting the message, such as the destination address, prior-
ity, and security level, all of which are distinct from the message itself. The mes-
sage transport agents use the envelope for routing, just as the post office does.
The message inside the envelope consists of two separate parts: the header
and the body. The header contains control information for the user agents. The
body is entirely for the human recipient. None of the agents care much about it.
Envelopes and messages are illustrated in Fig. 7-8.

We will examine the pieces of this architecture in more detail by looking at
the steps that are involved in sending email from one user to another. This journey
starts with the user agent.
7.2.2 The User Agent
A user agent is a program (sometimes called an email reader) that accepts a
variety of commands for composing, receiving, and replying to messages, as well
as for manipulating mailboxes. There are many popular user agents, including
Google gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Apple Mail. They
can vary greatly in their appearance. Most user agents have a menu- or icon-
driven graphical interface that requires a mouse, or a touch interface on smaller
mobile devices. Older user agents, such as Elm, mh, and Pine, provide text-based
interfaces and expect one-character commands from the keyboard. Functionally,
these are the same, at least for text messages.
The typical elements of a user agent interface are shown in Fig. 7-9. Your
mail reader is likely to be much flashier, but probably has equivalent functions.

When a user agent is started, it will usually present a summary of the messages in
the user’s mailbox. Often, the summary will have one line for each message in
some sorted order. It highlights key fields of the message that are extracted from
the message envelope or header.

Message
Figure 7-9. Typical elements of the user agent interface.
Seven summary lines are shown in the example of Fig. 7-9. The lines use the
From, Subject, and Received fields, in that order, to display who sent the message,
what it is about, and when it was received. All the information is formatted in a
user-friendly way rather than displaying the literal contents of the message fields,
but it is based on the message fields. Thus, people who fail to include a Subject
field often discover that responses to their emails tend not to get the highest prior-
ity.
Many other fields or indications are possible. The icons next to the message
subjects in Fig. 7-9 might indicate, for example, unread mail (the envelope), at-
tached material (the paperclip), and important mail, at least as judged by the send-
er (the exclamation point).
Many sorting orders are also possible. The most common is to order messages
based on the time that they were received, most recent first, with some indication
as to whether the message is new or has already been read by the user. The fields
in the summary and the sort order can be customized by the user according to her
preferences.
User agents must also be able to display incoming messages as needed so that
people can read their email. Often a short preview of a message is provided, as in
Fig. 7-9, to help users decide when to read further. Previews may use small icons
or images to describe the contents of the message. Other presentation processing

CHAP. 7
includes reformatting messages to fit the display, and translating or converting
contents to more convenient formats (e.g., digitized speech to recognized text).
After a message has been read, the user can decide what to do with it. This is
called message disposition. Options include deleting the message, sending a
reply, forwarding the message to another user, and keeping the message for later
reference. Most user agents can manage one mailbox for incoming mail with
multiple folders for saved mail. The folders allow the user to save message
according to sender, topic, or some other category.
Filing can be done automatically by the user agent as well, before the user
reads the messages. A common example is that the fields and contents of mes-
sages are inspected and used, along with feedback from the user about previous
messages, to determine if a message is likely to be spam. Many ISPs and com-
panies run software that labels mail as important or spam so that the user agent
can file it in the corresponding mailbox. The ISP and company have the advan-
tage of seeing mail for many users and may have lists of known spammers. If hun-
dreds of users have just received a similar message, it is probably spam. By
presorting incoming mail as ‘‘probably legitimate’’ and ‘‘probably spam,’’ the user
agent can save users a fair amount of work separating the good stuff from the
junk.
And the most popular spam? It is generated by collections of compromised
computers called botnets and its content depends on where you live. Fake diplo-
mas are topical in Asia, and cheap drugs and other dubious product offers are top-
ical in the U.S. Unclaimed Nigerian bank accounts still abound. Pills for enlarging
various body parts are common everywhere.
Other filing rules can be constructed by users. Each rule specifies a condition
and an action. For example, a rule could say that any message received from the
boss goes to one folder for immediate reading and any message from a particular
mailing list goes to another folder for later reading. Several folders are shown in
Fig. 7-9. The most important folders are the Inbox, for incoming mail not filed
elsewhere, and Junk Mail, for messages that are thought to be spam.
As well as explicit constructs like folders, user agents now provide rich capa-
bilities to search the mailbox. This feature is also shown in Fig. 7-9. Search capa-
bilities let users find messages quickly, such as the message about ‘‘where to buy
Vegemite’’ that someone sent in the last month.
Email has come a long way from the days when it was just file transfer. Pro-
viders now routinely support mailboxes with up to 1 GB of stored mail that details
a user’s interactions over a long period of time. The sophisticated mail handling
of user agents with search and automatic forms of processing is what makes it
possible to manage these large volumes of email. For people who send and re-
ceive thousands of messages a year, these tools are invaluable.
Another useful feature is the ability to automatically respond to messages in
some way. One response is to forward incoming email to a different address, for
example, a computer operated by a commercial paging service that pages the user

---

SEC. 7.2
ELECTRONIC MAIL
629
by using radio or satellite and displays the Subject: line on his pager. These auto-
responders must run in the mail server because the user agent may not run all the
time and may only occasionally retrieve email. Because of these factors, the user
agent cannot provide a true automatic response.
However, the interface for
automatic responses is usually presented by the user agent.
A different example of an automatic response is a vacation agent. This is a
program that examines each incoming message and sends the sender an insipid
reply such as: ‘‘Hi. I’m on vacation. I’ll be back on the 24th of August. Talk to
you then.’’ Such replies can also specify how to handle urgent matters in the
interim, other people to contact for specific problems, etc. Most vacation agents
keep track of whom they have sent canned replies to and refrain from sending the
same person a second reply. There are pitfalls with these agents, however. For
example, it is not advisable to send a canned reply to a large mailing list.
Let us now turn to the scenario of one user sending a message to another user.
One of the basic features user agents support that we have not yet discussed is
mail composition. It involves creating messages and answers to messages and
sending these messages into the rest of the mail system for delivery. Although
any text editor can be used to create the body of the message, editors are usually
integrated with the user agent so that it can provide assistance with addressing and
the numerous header fields attached to each message. For example, when answer-
ing a message, the email system can extract the originator’s address from the in-
coming email and automatically insert it into the proper place in the reply. Other
common features are appending a signature block to the bottom of a message,
correcting spelling, and computing digital signatures that show the message is
valid.
Messages that are sent into the mail system have a standard format that must
be created from the information supplied to the user agent. The most important
part of the message for transfer is the envelope, and the most important part of the
envelope is the destination address. This address must be in a format that the
message transfer agents can deal with.
The expected form of an address is user@dns-address. Since we studied
DNS earlier in this chapter, we will not repeat that material here. However, it is
worth noting that other forms of addressing exist. In particular, X.400 addresses
look radically different from DNS addresses.
X.400 is an ISO standard for message-handling systems that was at one time a
competitor to SMTP. SMTP won out handily, though X.400 systems are still used,
mostly outside of the U.S. X.400 addresses are composed of attribute=value
pairs separated by slashes, for example,
/C=US/ST=MASSACHUSETTS/L=CAMBRIDGE/PA=360 MEMORIAL DR./CN=KEN SMITH/
This address specifies a country, state, locality, personal address, and common
name (Ken Smith). Many other attributes are possible, so you can send email to

---

## Page 20

630
THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
someone whose exact email address you do not know, provided you know enough
other attributes (e.g., company and job title).
Although X.400 names are considerably less convenient than DNS names, the
issue is moot for user agents because they have user-friendly aliases (sometimes
called nicknames) that allow users to enter or select a person’s name and get the
correct email address. Consequently, it is usually not necessary to actually type in
these strange strings.
A final point we will touch on for sending mail is mailing lists, which let users
send the same message to a list of people with a single command. There are two
choices for how the mailing list is maintained. It might be maintained locally, by
the user agent. In this case, the user agent can just send a separate message to
each intended recipient.
Alternatively, the list may be maintained remotely at a message transfer
agent. Messages will then be expanded in the message transfer system, which has
the effect of allowing multiple users to send to the list. For example, if a group of
bird watchers has a mailing list called birders installed on the transfer agent
meadowlark.arizona.edu, any message sent to birders@meadowlark.arizona.edu
will be routed to the University of Arizona and expanded into individual messages
to all the mailing list members, wherever in the world they may be. Users of this
mailing list cannot tell that it is a mailing list. It could just as well be the personal
mailbox of Prof. Gabriel O. Birders.
7.2.3 Message Formats
Now we turn from the user interface to the format of the email messages
themselves. Messages sent by the user agent must be placed in a standard format
to be handled by the message transfer agents. First we will look at basic ASCII
email using RFC 5322, which is the latest revision of the original Internet mes-
sage format as described in RFC 822. After that, we will look at multimedia ex-
tensions to the basic format.
RFC 5322—The Internet Message Format
Messages consist of a primitive envelope (described as part of SMTP in RFC
5321), some number of header fields, a blank line, and then the message body.
Each header field (logically) consists of a single line of ASCII text containing the
field name, a colon, and, for most fields, a value. The original RFC 822 was de-
signed decades ago and did not clearly distinguish the envelope fields from the
header fields. Although it has been revised to RFC 5322, completely redoing it
was not possible due to its widespread usage. In normal usage, the user agent
builds a message and passes it to the message transfer agent, which then uses
some of the header fields to construct the actual envelope, a somewhat old-
fashioned mixing of message and envelope.

The principal header fields related to message transport are listed in Fig. 7-10.
The To: field gives the DNS address of the primary recipient. Having multiple re-
cipients is also allowed. The Cc: field gives the addresses of any secondary recip-
ients. In terms of delivery, there is no distinction between the primary and sec-
ondary recipients. It is entirely a psychological difference that may be important
to the people involved but is not important to the mail system. The term Cc: (Car-
bon copy) is a bit dated, since computers do not use carbon paper, but it is well es-
tablished. The Bcc: (Blind carbon copy) field is like the Cc: field, except that this
line is deleted from all the copies sent to the primary and secondary recipients.
This feature allows people to send copies to third parties without the primary and
secondary recipients knowing this.

Figure 7-10. RFC 5322 header fields related to message transport.
The next two fields, From: and Sender:, tell who wrote and sent the message,
respectively. These need not be the same. For example, a business executive
may write a message, but her assistant may be the one who actually transmits it.
In this case, the executive would be listed in the From: field and the assistant in
the Sender: field. The From: field is required, but the Sender: field may be omit-
ted if it is the same as the From: field. These fields are needed in case the mes-
sage is undeliverable and must be returned to the sender.
A line containing Received: is added by each message transfer agent along the
way. The line contains the agent’s identity, the date and time the message was re-
ceived, and other information that can be used for debugging the routing system.
The Return-Path: field is added by the final message transfer agent and was
intended to tell how to get back to the sender. In theory, this information can be
gathered from all the Received: headers (except for the name of the sender’s mail-
box), but it is rarely filled in as such and typically just contains the sender’s ad-
dress.
In addition to the fields of Fig. 7-10, RFC 5322 messages may also contain a
variety of header fields used by the user agents or human recipients. The most
common ones are listed in Fig. 7-11. Most of these are self-explanatory, so we
will not go into all of them in much detail.

The Reply-To: field is sometimes used when neither the person composing the
message nor the person sending the message wants to see the reply. For example,
a marketing manager may write an email message telling customers about a new
product. The message is sent by an assistant, but the Reply-To: field lists the head
of the sales department, who can answer questions and take orders. This field is
also useful when the sender has two email accounts and wants the reply to go to
the other one.
The Message-Id: is an automatically generated number that is used to link
messages together (e.g., when used in the In-Reply-To: field) and to prevent dupli-
cate delivery.
The RFC 5322 document explicitly says that users are allowed to invent op-
tional headers for their own private use. By convention since RFC 822, these
headers start with the string X-. It is guaranteed that no future headers will use
names starting with X-, to avoid conflicts between official and private headers.
Sometimes wiseguy undergraduates make up fields like X-Fruit-of-the-Day: or
X-Disease-of-the-Week:, which are legal, although not always illuminating.
After the headers comes the message body. Users can put whatever they want
here. Some people terminate their messages with elaborate signatures, including
quotations from greater and lesser authorities, political statements, and disclai-
mers of all kinds (e.g., The XYZ Corporation is not responsible for my opinions;
in fact, it cannot even comprehend them).
MIME—The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
In the early days of the ARPANET, email consisted exclusively of text mes-
sages written in English and expressed in ASCII. For this environment, the early
RFC 822 format did the job completely: it specified the headers but left the con-
tent entirely up to the users. In the 1990s, the worldwide use of the Internet and
demand to send richer content through the mail system meant that this approach
was no longer adequate. The problems included sending and receiving messages

in languages with accents (e.g., French and German), non-Latin alphabets (e.g.,
Hebrew and Russian), or no alphabets (e.g., Chinese and Japanese), as well as
sending messages not containing text at all (e.g., audio, images, or binary docu-
ments and programs).
The solution was the development of MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions). It is widely used for mail messages that are sent across the Internet,
as well as to describe content for other applications such as Web browsing.
MIME is described in RFCs 2045–2047, 4288, 4289, and 2049.
The basic idea of MIME is to continue to use the RFC 822 format (the precur-
sor to RFC 5322 the time MIME was proposed) but to add structure to the mes-
sage body and define encoding rules for the transfer of non-ASCII messages. Not
deviating from RFC 822 allowed MIME messages to be sent using the existing
mail transfer agents and protocols (based on RFC 821 then, and RFC 5321 now).
All that had to be changed were the sending and receiving programs, which users
could do for themselves.
MIME defines five new message headers, as shown in Fig. 7-12. The first of
these simply tells the user agent receiving the message that it is dealing with a
MIME message, and which version of MIME it uses. Any message not con-
taining a MIME-Version: header is assumed to be an English plaintext message
(or at least one using only ASCII characters) and is processed as such.
Header
Meaning
MIME-Version:
Identifies the MIME version
Content-Description:
Human-readable string telling what is in the message
Content-Id:
Unique identifier
Content-Transfer-Encoding:
How the body is wrapped for transmission
Content-Type:
Type and format of the content
Figure 7-12. Message headers added by MIME.
The Content-Description: header is an ASCII string telling what is in the mes-
sage. This header is needed so the recipient will know whether it is worth decod-
ing and reading the message. If the string says ‘‘Photo of Barbara’s hamster’’ and
the person getting the message is not a big hamster fan, the message will probably
be discarded rather than decoded into a high-resolution color photograph.
The Content-Id: header identifies the content. It uses the same format as the
standard Message-Id: header.
The Content-Transfer-Encoding: tells how the body is wrapped for transmis-
sion through the network. A key problem at the time MIME was developed was
that the mail transfer (SMTP) protocols expected ASCII messages in which no
line exceeded 1000 characters. ASCII characters use 7 bits out of each 8-bit byte.
Binary data such as executable programs and images use all 8 bits of each byte, as

---

## Page 24

634
THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
do extended character sets. There was no guarantee this data would be transferred
safely. Hence, some method of carrying binary data that made it look like a regu-
lar ASCII mail message was needed. Extensions to SMTP since the development
of MIME do allow 8-bit binary data to be transferred, though even today binary
data may not always go through the mail system correctly if unencoded.
MIME provides five transfer encoding schemes, plus an escape to new
schemes—just in case. The simplest scheme is just ASCII text messages. ASCII
characters use 7 bits and can be carried directly by the email protocol, provided
that no line exceeds 1000 characters.
The next simplest scheme is the same thing, but using 8-bit characters, that is,
all values from 0 up to and including 255 are allowed. Messages using the 8-bit
encoding must still adhere to the standard maximum line length.
Then there are messages that use a true binary encoding. These are arbitrary
binary files that not only use all 8 bits but also do not adhere to the 1000-character
line limit. Executable programs fall into this category. Nowadays, mail servers
can negotiate to send data in binary (or 8-bit) encoding, falling back to ASCII if
both ends do not support the extension.
The ASCII encoding of binary data is called base64 encoding.
In this
scheme, groups of 24 bits are broken up into four 6-bit units, with each unit being
sent as a legal ASCII character. The coding is ‘‘A’’ for 0, ‘‘B’’ for 1, and so on,
followed by the 26 lowercase letters, the 10 digits, and finally + and / for 62 and
63, respectively. The == and = sequences indicate that the last group contained
only 8 or 16 bits, respectively. Carriage returns and line feeds are ignored, so
they can be inserted at will in the encoded character stream to keep the lines short
enough. Arbitrary binary text can be sent safely using this scheme, albeit ineffi-
ciently. This encoding was very popular before binary-capable mail servers were
widely deployed. It is still commonly seen.
For messages that are almost entirely ASCII but with a few non-ASCII char-
acters, base64 encoding is somewhat inefficient. Instead, an encoding known as
quoted-printable encoding is used. This is just 7-bit ASCII, with all the charac-
ters above 127 encoded as an equals sign followed by the character’s value as two
hexadecimal digits. Control characters, some punctuation marks and math symb-
ols, as well as trailing spaces are also so encoded.
Finally, when there are valid reasons not to use one of these schemes, it is
possible to specify a user-defined encoding in the Content-Transfer-Encoding:
header.
The last header shown in Fig. 7-12 is really the most interesting one. It speci-
fies the nature of the message body and has had an impact well beyond email. For
instance, content downloaded from the Web is labeled with MIME types so that
the browser knows how to present it. So is content sent over streaming media and
real-time transports such as voice over IP.
Initially, seven MIME types were defined in RFC 1521. Each type has one or
more available subtypes. The type and subtype are separated by a slash, as in

---

‘‘Content-Type: video/mpeg’’. Since then, hundreds of subtypes have been added,
along with another type. Additional entries are being added all the time as new
types of content are developed. The list of assigned types and subtypes is main-
tained online by IANA at www.iana.org/assignments/media-types.
The types, along with examples of commonly used subtypes, are given in
Fig. 7-13. Let us briefly go through them, starting with text. The text/plain com-
bination is for ordinary messages that can be displayed as received, with no en-
coding and no further processing. This option allows ordinary messages to be
transported in MIME with only a few extra headers. The text/html subtype was
added when the Web became popular (in RFC 2854) to allow Web pages to be
sent in RFC 822 email. A subtype for the eXtensible Markup Language, text/xml,
is defined in RFC 3023. XML documents have proliferated with the development
of the Web. We will study HTML and XML in Sec. 7.3.

Figure 7-13. MIME content types and example subtypes.
The next MIME type is image, which is used to transmit still pictures. Many
formats are widely used for storing and transmitting images nowadays, both with
and without compression. Several of these, including GIF, JPEG, and TIFF, are
built into nearly all browsers. Many other formats and corresponding subtypes
exist as well.
The audio and video types are for sound and moving pictures, respectively.
Please note that video may include only the visual information, not the sound. If
a movie with sound is to be transmitted, the video and audio portions may have to
be transmitted separately, depending on the encoding system used. The first video
format defined was the one devised by the modestly named Moving Picture
Experts Group (MPEG), but others have been added since.
In addition to
audio/basic, a new audio type, audio/mpeg, was added in RFC 3003 to allow peo-
ple to email MP3 audio files. The video/mp4 and audio/mp4 types signal video
and audio data that are stored in the newer MPEG 4 format.
The model type was added after the other content types. It is intended for
describing 3D model data. However, it has not been widely used to date.

CHAP. 7
The application type is a catchall for formats that are not covered by one of
the other types and that require an application to interpret the data. We have lis-
ted the subtypes pdf, javascript, and zip as examples for PDF documents, Java-
Script programs, and Zip archives, respectively. User agents that receive this con-
tent use a third-party library or external program to display the content; the dis-
play may or may not appear to be integrated with the user agent.
By using MIME types, user agents gain the extensibility to handle new types
of application content as it is developed. This is a significant benefit. On the other
hand, many of the new forms of content are executed or interpreted by applica-
tions, which presents some dangers. Obviously, running an arbitrary executable
program that has arrived via the mail system from ‘‘friends’’ poses a security haz-
ard. The program may do all sorts of nasty damage to the parts of the computer to
which it has access, especially if it can read and write files and use the network.
Less obviously, document formats can pose the same hazards. This is because
formats such as PDF are full-blown programming languages in disguise. While
they are interpreted and restricted in scope, bugs in the interpreter often allow
devious documents to escape the restrictions.
Besides these examples, there are many more application subtypes because
there are many more applications. As a fallback to be used when no other subtype
is known to be more fitting, the octet-stream subtype denotes a sequence of unin-
terpreted bytes. Upon receiving such a stream, it is likely that a user agent will
display it by suggesting to the user that it be copied to a file. Subsequent proc-
essing is then up to the user, who presumably knows what kind of content it is.
The last two types are useful for composing and manipulating messages them-
selves. The message type allows one message to be fully encapsulated inside an-
other. This scheme is useful for forwarding email, for example. When a com-
plete RFC 822 message is encapsulated inside an outer message, the rfc822 sub-
type should be used. Similarly, it is common for HTML documents to be encap-
sulated. And the partial subtype makes it possible to break an encapsulated mes-
sage into pieces and send them separately (for example, if the encapsulated mes-
sage is too long). Parameters make it possible to reassemble all the parts at the
destination in the correct order.
Finally, the multipart type allows a message to contain more than one part,
with the beginning and end of each part being clearly delimited. The mixed sub-
type allows each part to be a different type, with no additional structure imposed.
Many email programs allow the user to provide one or more attachments to a text
message. These attachments are sent using the multipart type.
In contrast to mixed, the alternative subtype allows the same message to be
included multiple times but expressed in two or more different media. For ex-
ample, a message could be sent in plain ASCII, in HMTL, and in PDF. A properly
designed user agent getting such a message would display it according to user
preferences. Likely PDF would be the first choice, if that is possible. The second
choice would be HTML. If neither of these were possible, then the flat ASCII

text would be displayed. The parts should be ordered from simplest to most com-
plex to help recipients with pre-MIME user agents make some sense of the mes-
sage (e.g., even a pre-MIME user can read flat ASCII text).
The alternative subtype can also be used for multiple languages. In this con-
text, the Rosetta Stone can be thought of as an early multipart/alternative mes-
sage.
Of the other two example subtypes, the parallel subtype is used when all parts
must be ‘‘viewed’’ simultaneously. For example, movies often have an audio
channel and a video channel. Movies are more effective if these two channels are
played back in parallel, instead of consecutively. The digest subtype is used when
multiple messages are packed together into a composite message. For example,
some discussion groups on the Internet collect messages from subscribers and
then send them out to the group periodically as a single multipart/digest message.
As an example of how MIME types may be used for email messages, a multi-
media message is shown in Fig. 7-14. Here, a birthday greeting is transmitted in
alternative forms as HTML and as an audio file. Assuming the receiver has audio
capability, the user agent there will play the sound file. In this example, the sound
is carried by reference as a message/external-body subtype, so first the user agent
must fetch the sound file birthday.snd using FTP. If the user agent has no audio
capability, the lyrics are displayed on the screen in stony silence. The two parts
are delimited by two hyphens followed by a (software-generated) string specified
in the boundary parameter.
Note that the Content-Type header occurs in three positions within this ex-
ample. At the top level, it indicates that the message has multiple parts. Within
each part, it gives the type and subtype of that part. Finally, within the body of
the second part, it is required to tell the user agent what kind of external file it is
to fetch. To indicate this slight difference in usage, we have used lowercase let-
ters here, although all headers are case insensitive. The Content-Transfer-En-
coding is similarly required for any external body that is not encoded as 7-bit
ASCII.
7.2.4 Message Transfer
Now that we have described user agents and mail messages, we are ready to
look at how the message transfer agents relay messages from the originator to the
recipient. The mail transfer is done with the SMTP protocol.
The simplest way to move messages is to establish a transport connection
from the source machine to the destination machine and then just transfer the mes-
sage. This is how SMTP originally worked. Over the years, however, two dif-
ferent uses of SMTP have been differentiated. The first use is mail submission,
step 1 in the email architecture of Fig. 7-7. This is the means by which user
agents send messages into the mail system for delivery. The second use is to
transfer messages between message transfer agents (step 2 in Fig. 7-7). This

sequence delivers mail all the way from the sending to the receiving message
transfer agent in one hop. Final delivery is accomplished with different protocols
that we will describe in the next section.
In this section, we will describe the basics of the SMTP protocol and its ex-
tension mechanism. Then we will discuss how it is used differently for mail sub-
mission and message transfer.
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and Extensions
Within the Internet, email is delivered by having the sending computer estab-
lish a TCP connection to port 25 of the receiving computer. Listening to this port
is a mail server that speaks SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This ser-
ver accepts incoming connections, subject to some security checks, and accepts
messages for delivery. If a message cannot be delivered, an error report con-
taining the first part of the undeliverable message is returned to the sender.
SMTP is a simple ASCII protocol. This is not a weakness but a feature.
Using ASCII text makes protocols easy to develop, test, and debug. They can be

tested by sending commands manually, and records of the messages are easy to
read. Most application-level Internet protocols now work this way (e.g., HTTP).
We will walk through a simple message transfer between mail servers that de-
livers a message. After establishing the TCP connection to port 25, the sending
machine, operating as the client, waits for the receiving machine, operating as the
server, to talk first. The server starts by sending a line of text giving its identity
and telling whether it is prepared to receive mail. If it is not, the client releases
the connection and tries again later.
If the server is willing to accept email, the client announces whom the email
is coming from and whom it is going to. If such a recipient exists at the destina-
tion, the server gives the client the go-ahead to send the message. Then the client
sends the message and the server acknowledges it. No checksums are needed be-
cause TCP provides a reliable byte stream. If there is more email, that is now
sent. When all the email has been exchanged in both directions, the connection is
released. A sample dialog for sending the message of Fig. 7-14, including the
numerical codes used by SMTP, is shown in Fig. 7-15. The lines sent by the cli-
ent (i.e., the sender) are marked C:. Those sent by the server (i.e., the receiver)
are marked S:.
The first command from the client is indeed meant to be HELO. Of the vari-
ous four-character abbreviations for HELLO, this one has numerous advantages
over its biggest competitor. Why all the commands had to be four characters has
been lost in the mists of time.
In Fig. 7-15, the message is sent to only one recipient, so only one RCPT
command is used. Such commands are allowed to send a single message to multi-
ple receivers. Each one is individually acknowledged or rejected. Even if some
recipients are rejected (because they do not exist at the destination), the message
can be sent to the other ones.
Finally, although the syntax of the four-character commands from the client is
rigidly specified, the syntax of the replies is less rigid. Only the numerical code
really counts. Each implementation can put whatever string it wants after the
code.
The basic SMTP works well, but it is limited in several respects. It does not
include authentication. This means that the FROM command in the example could
give any sender address that it pleases. This is quite useful for sending spam. An-
other limitation is that SMTP transfers ASCII messages, not binary data. This is
why the base64 MIME content transfer encoding was needed. However, with that
encoding the mail transmission uses bandwidth inefficiently, which is an issue for
large messages. A third limitation is that SMTP sends messages in the clear. It
has no encryption to provide a measure of privacy against prying eyes.
To allow these and many other problems related to message processing to be
addressed, SMTP was revised to have an extension mechanism. This mechanism
is a mandatory part of the RFC 5321 standard. The use of SMTP with extensions
is called ESMTP (Extended SMTP).

Clients wanting to use an extension send an EHLO message instead of HELO
initially. If this is rejected, the server is a regular SMTP server, and the client
should proceed in the usual way. If the EHLO is accepted, the server replies with
the extensions that it supports. The client may then use any of these extensions.
Several common extensions are shown in Fig. 7-16. The figure gives the keyword

Figure 7-16. Some SMTP extensions.
To get a better feel for how SMTP and some of the other protocols described
in this chapter work, try them out. In all cases, first go to a machine connected to
the Internet. On a UNIX (or Linux) system, in a shell, type
telnet mail.isp.com 25
substituting the DNS name of your ISP’s mail server for mail.isp.com. On a Win-
dows XP system, click on Start, then Run, and type the command in the dialog
box. On a Vista or Windows 7 machine, you may have to first install the telnet
program (or equivalent) and then start it yourself. This command will establish a
telnet (i.e., TCP) connection to port 25 on that machine. Port 25 is the SMTP
port; see Fig. 6-34 for the ports for other common protocols. You will probably
get a response something like this:
Trying 192.30.200.66...
Connected to mail.isp.com
Escape character is ’ˆ]’.
220 mail.isp.com Smail #74 ready at Thu, 25 Sept 2002 13:26 +0200
The first three lines are from telnet, telling you what it is doing. The last line is
from the SMTP server on the remote machine, announcing its willingness to talk
to you and accept email. To find out what commands it accepts, type
HELP
From this point on, a command sequence such as the one in Fig. 7-16 is possible if
the server is willing to accept mail from you.
Mail Submission
Originally, user agents ran on the same computer as the sending message
transfer agent. In this setting, all that is required to send a message is for the user
agent to talk to the local mail server, using the dialog that we have just described.
However, this setting is no longer the usual case.

---

## Page 32

THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
User agents often run on laptops, home PCs, and mobile phones. They are not
always connected to the Internet. Mail transfer agents run on ISP and company
servers. They are always connected to the Internet. This difference means that a
user agent in Boston may need to contact its regular mail server in Seattle to send
a mail message because the user is traveling.
By itself, this remote communication poses no problem. It is exactly what the
TCP/IP protocols are designed to support. However, an ISP or company usually
does not want any remote user to be able to submit messages to its mail server to
be delivered elsewhere. The ISP or company is not running the server as a public
service. In addition, this kind of open mail relay attracts spammers. This is be-
cause it provides a way to launder the original sender and thus make the message
more difficult to identify as spam.
Given these considerations, SMTP is normally used for mail submission with
the AUTH extension. This extension lets the server check the credentials (user-
name and password) of the client to confirm that the server should be providing
mail service.
There are several other differences in the way SMTP is used for mail submis-
sion. For example, port 587 is used in preference to port 25 and the SMTP server
can check and correct the format of the messages sent by the user agent. For
more information about the restricted use of SMTP for mail submission, please
see RFC 4409.
Message Transfer
Once the sending mail transfer agent receives a message from the user agent,
it will deliver it to the receiving mail transfer agent using SMTP. To do this, the
sender uses the destination address. Consider the message in Fig. 7-15, addressed
to bob@ee.uwa.edu.au. To what mail server should the message be delivered?
To determine the correct mail server to contact, DNS is consulted. In the pre-
vious section, we described how DNS contains multiple types of records, includ-
ing the MX, or mail exchanger, record. In this case, a DNS query is made for the
MX records of the domain ee.uwa.edu.au. This query returns an ordered list of the
names and IP addresses of one or more mail servers.
The sending mail transfer agent then makes a TCP connection on port 25 to
the IP address of the mail server to reach the receiving mail transfer agent, and
uses SMTP to relay the message. The receiving mail transfer agent will then place
mail for the user bob in the correct mailbox for Bob to read it at a later time. This
local delivery step may involve moving the message among computers if there is
a large mail infrastructure.
With this delivery process, mail travels from the initial to the final mail trans-
fer agent in a single hop. There are no intermediate servers in the message transfer
stage. It is possible, however, for this delivery process to occur multiple times.
One example that we have described already is when a message transfer agent

---

## Page 33

SEC. 7.2
ELECTRONIC MAIL
643
implements a mailing list. In this case, a message is received for the list. It is then
expanded as a message to each member of the list that is sent to the individual
member addresses.
As another example of relaying, Bob may have graduated from M.I.T. and
also be reachable via the address bob@alum.mit.edu. Rather than reading mail on
multiple accounts, Bob can arrange for mail sent to this address to be forwarded to
bob@ee.uwa.edu. In this case, mail sent to bob@alum.mit.edu will undergo two
deliveries. First, it will be sent to the mail server for alum.mit.edu. Then, it will be
sent to the mail server for ee.uwa.edu.au. Each of these legs is a complete and
separate delivery as far as the mail transfer agents are concerned.
Another consideration nowadays is spam. Nine out of ten messages sent today
are spam (McAfee, 2010). Few people want more spam, but it is hard to avoid
because it masquerades as regular mail. Before accepting a message, additional
checks may be made to reduce the opportunities for spam. The message for Bob
was sent from alice@cs.washington.edu. The receiving mail transfer agent can
look up the sending mail transfer agent in DNS. This lets it check that the IP ad-
dress of the other end of the TCP connection matches the DNS name. More gen-
erally, the receiving agent may look up the sending domain in DNS to see if it has
a mail sending policy. This information is often given in the TXT and SPF
records. It may indicate that other checks can be made. For example, mail sent
from cs.washington.edu may always be sent from the host june.cs.washington.edu.
If the sending mail transfer agent is not june, there is a problem.
If any of these checks fail, the mail is probably being forged with a fake send-
ing address. In this case, it is discarded. However, passing these checks does not
imply that mail is not spam. The checks merely ensure that the mail seems to be
coming from the region of the network that it purports to come from. The idea is
that spammers should be forced to use the correct sending address when they send
mail. This makes spam easier to recognize and delete when it is unwanted.
7.2.5 Final Delivery
Our mail message is almost delivered. It has arrived at Bob’s mailbox. All
that remains is to transfer a copy of the message to Bob’s user agent for display.
This is step 3 in the architecture of Fig. 7-7. This task was straightforward in the
early Internet, when the user agent and mail transfer agent ran on the same ma-
chine as different processes. The mail transfer agent simply wrote new messages
to the end of the mailbox file, and the user agent simply checked the mailbox file
for new mail.
Nowadays, the user agent on a PC, laptop, or mobile, is likely to be on a dif-
ferent machine than the ISP or company mail server. Users want to be able to ac-
cess their mail remotely, from wherever they are. They want to access email from
work, from their home PCs, from their laptops when on business trips, and from
cybercafes when on so-called vacation. They also want to be able to work offline,

then reconnect to receive incoming mail and send outgoing mail. Moreover, each
user may run several user agents depending on what computer it is convenient to
use at the moment. Several user agents may even be running at the same time.
In this setting, the job of the user agent is to present a view of the contents of
the mailbox, and to allow the mailbox to be remotely manipulated. Several dif-
ferent protocols can be used for this purpose, but SMTP is not one of them. SMTP
is a push-based protocol. It takes a message and connects to a remote server to
transfer the message. Final delivery cannot be achieved in this manner both be-
cause the mailbox must continue to be stored on the mail transfer agent and be-
cause the user agent may not be connected to the Internet at the moment that
SMTP attempts to relay messages.
IMAP—The Internet Message Access Protocol
One of the main protocols that is used for final delivery is IMAP (Internet
Message Access Protocol). Version 4 of the protocol is defined in RFC 3501.
To use IMAP, the mail server runs an IMAP server that listens to port 143. The
user agent runs an IMAP client. The client connects to the server and begins to
issue commands from those listed in Fig. 7-17.
First, the client will start a secure transport if one is to be used (in order to
keep the messages and commands confidential), and then log in or otherwise
authenticate itself to the server. Once logged in, there are many commands to list
folders and messages, fetch messages or even parts of messages, mark messages
with flags for later deletion, and organize messages into folders. To avoid confu-
sion, please note that we use the term ‘‘folder’’ here to be consistent with the rest
of the material in this section, in which a user has a single mailbox made up of
multiple folders. However, in the IMAP specification, the term mailbox is used
instead. One user thus has many IMAP mailboxes, each of which is typically pres-
ented to the user as a folder.
IMAP has many other features, too. It has the ability to address mail not by
message number, but by using attributes (e.g., give me the first message from
Alice). Searches can be performed on the server to find the messages that satisfy
certain criteria so that only those messages are fetched by the client.
IMAP is an improvement over an earlier final delivery protocol, POP3 (Post
Office Protocol, version 3), which is specified in RFC 1939. POP3 is a simpler
protocol but supports fewer features and is less secure in typical usage. Mail is
usually downloaded to the user agent computer, instead of remaining on the mail
server. This makes life easier on the server, but harder on the user. It is not easy to
read mail on multiple computers, plus if the user agent computer breaks, all email
may be lost permanently. Nonetheless, you will still find POP3 in use.
Proprietary protocols can also be used because the protocol runs between a
mail server and user agent that can be supplied by the same company. Microsoft
Exchange is a mail system with a proprietary protocol.

Webmail
An increasingly popular alternative to IMAP and SMTP for providing email
service is to use the Web as an interface for sending and receiving mail. Widely
used Webmail systems include Google Gmail, Microsoft Hotmail and Yahoo!
Mail. Webmail is one example of software (in this case, a mail user agent) that is
provided as a service using the Web.
In this architecture, the provider runs mail servers as usual to accept messages
for users with SMTP on port 25. However, the user agent is different. Instead of

being a standalone program, it is a user interface that is provided via Web pages.
This means that users can use any browser they like to access their mail and send
new messages.
We have not yet studied the Web, but a brief description that you might come
back to is as follows. When the user goes to the email Web page of the provider, a
form is presented in which the user is asked for a login name and password. The
login name and password are sent to the server, which then validates them. If the
login is successful, the server finds the user’s mailbox and builds a Web page list-
ing the contents of the mailbox on the fly. The Web page is then sent to the brow-
ser for display.
Many of the items on the page showing the mailbox are clickable, so mes-
sages can be read, deleted, and so on. To make the interface responsive, the Web
pages will often include JavaScript programs. These programs are run locally on
the client in response to local events (e.g., mouse clicks) and can also download
and upload messages in the background, to prepare the next message for display
or a new message for submission. In this model, mail submission happens using
the normal Web protocols by posting data to a URL. The Web server takes care of
injecting messages into the traditional mail delivery system that we have de-
scribed. For security, the standard Web protocols can be used as well. These pro-
tocols concern themselves with encrypting Web pages, not whether the content of
the Web page is a mail message.
7.3 THE WORLD WIDE WEB
The Web, as the World Wide Web is popularly known, is an architectural
framework for accessing linked content spread out over millions of machines all
over the Internet. In 10 years it went from being a way to coordinate the design of
high-energy physics experiments in Switzerland to the application that millions of
people think of as being ‘‘The Internet.’’ Its enormous popularity stems from the
fact that it is easy for beginners to use and provides access with a rich graphical
interface to an enormous wealth of information on almost every conceivable sub-
ject, from aardvarks to Zulus.
The Web began in 1989 at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research.
The initial idea was to help large teams, often with members in half a dozen or
more countries and time zones, collaborate using a constantly changing collection
of reports, blueprints, drawings, photos, and other documents produced by experi-
ments in particle physics. The proposal for a web of linked documents came from
CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee. The first (text-based) prototype was opera-
tional 18 months later. A public demonstration given at the Hypertext ’91 confer-
ence caught the attention of other researchers, which led Marc Andreessen at the
University of Illinois to develop the first graphical browser. It was called Mosaic
and released in February 1993.

The rest, as they say, is now history. Mosaic was so popular that a year later
Andreessen left to form a company, Netscape Communications Corp., whose goal
was to develop Web software. For the next three years, Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft’s Internet Explorer engaged in a ‘‘browser war,’’ each one trying to
capture a larger share of the new market by frantically adding more features (and
thus more bugs) than the other one.
Through the 1990s and 2000s, Web sites and Web pages, as Web content is
called, grew exponentially until there were millions of sites and billions of pages.
A small number of these sites became tremendously popular. Those sites and the
companies behind them largely define the Web as people experience it today. Ex-
amples include: a bookstore (Amazon, started in 1994, market capitalization $50
billion), a flea market (eBay, 1995, $30B), search (Google, 1998, $150B), and
social networking (Facebook, 2004, private company valued at more than $15B).
The period through 2000, when many Web companies became worth hundreds of
millions of dollars overnight, only to go bust practically the next day when they
turned out to be hype, even has a name. It is called the dot com era. New ideas
are still striking it rich on the Web. Many of them come from students. For ex-
ample, Mark Zuckerberg was a Harvard student when he started Facebook, and
Sergey Brin and Larry Page were students at Stanford when they started Google.
Perhaps you will come up with the next big thing.
In 1994, CERN and M.I.T. signed an agreement setting up the W3C (World
Wide Web Consortium), an organization devoted to further developing the Web,
standardizing protocols, and encouraging interoperability between sites. Berners-
Lee became the director. Since then, several hundred universities and companies
have joined the consortium. Although there are now more books about the Web
than you can shake a stick at, the best place to get up-to-date information about
the Web is (naturally) on the Web itself. The consortium’s home page is at
www.w3.org. Interested readers are referred there for links to pages covering all
of the consortium’s numerous documents and activities.
7.3.1 Architectural Overview
From the users’ point of view, the Web consists of a vast, worldwide collec-
tion of content in the form of Web pages, often just called pages for short. Each
page may contain links to other pages anywhere in the world. Users can follow a
link by clicking on it, which then takes them to the page pointed to. This process
can be repeated indefinitely. The idea of having one page point to another, now
called hypertext, was invented by a visionary M.I.T. professor of electrical en-
gineering, Vannevar Bush, in 1945 (Bush, 1945). This was long before the Inter-
net was invented. In fact, it was before commercial computers existed although
several universities had produced crude prototypes that filled large rooms and had
less power than a modern pocket calculator.

Pages are generally viewed with a program called a browser. Firefox, Inter-
net Explorer, and Chrome are examples of popular browsers. The browser fetches
the page requested, interprets the content, and displays the page, properly for-
matted, on the screen. The content itself may be a mix of text, images, and for-
matting commands, in the manner of a traditional document, or other forms of
content such as video or programs that produce a graphical interface with which
users can interact.
A picture of a page is shown on the top-left side of Fig. 7-18. It is the page
for the Computer Science & Engineering department at the University of Wash-
ington. This page shows text and graphical elements (that are mostly too small to
read). Some parts of the page are associated with links to other pages. A piece of
text, icon, image, and so on associated with another page is called a hyperlink.
To follow a link, the user places the mouse cursor on the linked portion of the
page area (which causes the cursor to change shape) and clicks. Following a link
is simply a way of telling the browser to fetch another page. In the early days of
the Web, links were highlighted with underlining and colored text so that they
would stand out. Nowadays, the creators of Web pages have ways to control the
look of linked regions, so a link might appear as an icon or change its appearance
when the mouse passes over it. It is up to the creators of the page to make the
links visually distinct, to provide a usable interface.

Students in the department can learn more by following a link to a page with
information especially for them. This link is accessed by clicking in the circled
area. The browser then fetches the new page and displays it, as partially shown in
the bottom left of Fig. 7-18. Dozens of other pages are linked off the first page
besides this example. Every other page can be comprised of content on the same
machine(s) as the first page, or on machines halfway around the globe. The user
cannot tell. Page fetching is done by the browser, without any help from the user.
Thus, moving between machines while viewing content is seamless.
The basic model behind the display of pages is also shown in Fig. 7-18. The
browser is displaying a Web page on the client machine. Each page is fetched by
sending a request to one or more servers, which respond with the contents of the
page. The request-response protocol for fetching pages is a simple text-based pro-
tocol that runs over TCP, just as was the case for SMTP. It is called HTTP
(HyperText Transfer Protocol). The content may simply be a document that is
read off a disk, or the result of a database query and program execution. The page
is a static page if it is a document that is the same every time it is displayed. In
contrast, if it was generated on demand by a program or contains a program it is a
dynamic page.
A dynamic page may present itself differently each time it is displayed. For
example, the front page for an electronic store may be different for each visitor.
If a bookstore customer has bought mystery novels in the past, upon visiting the
store’s main page, the customer is likely to see new thrillers prominently display-
ed, whereas a more culinary-minded customer might be greeted with new cook-
books. How the Web site keeps track of who likes what is a story to be told short-
ly. But briefly, the answer involves cookies (even for culinarily challenged visi-
tors).
In the figure, the browser contacts three servers to fetch the two pages,
cs.washington.edu, youtube.com, and google-analytics.com. The content from
these different servers is integrated for display by the browser. Display entails a
range of processing that depends on the kind of content. Besides rendering text
and graphics, it may involve playing a video or running a script that presents its
own user interface as part of the page. In this case, the cs.washington.edu server
supplies the main page, the youtube.com server supplies an embedded video, and
the google-analytics.com server supplies nothing that the user can see but tracks
visitors to the site. We will have more to say about trackers later.
The Client Side
Let us now examine the Web browser side in Fig. 7-18 in more detail. In
essence, a browser is a program that can display a Web page and catch mouse
clicks to items on the displayed page. When an item is selected, the browser fol-
lows the hyperlink and fetches the page selected.

When the Web was first created, it was immediately apparent that having one
page point to another Web page required mechanisms for naming and locating
pages. In particular, three questions had to be answered before a selected page
could be displayed:
1. What is the page called?
2. Where is the page located?
3. How can the page be accessed?
If every page were somehow assigned a unique name, there would not be any
ambiguity in identifying pages. Nevertheless, the problem would not be solved.
Consider a parallel between people and pages. In the United States, almost every-
one has a social security number, which is a unique identifier, as no two people
are supposed to have the same one. Nevertheless, if you are armed only with a
social security number, there is no way to find the owner’s address, and certainly
no way to tell whether you should write to the person in English, Spanish, or
Chinese. The Web has basically the same problems.
The solution chosen identifies pages in a way that solves all three problems at
once.
Each page is assigned a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that ef-
fectively serves as the page’s worldwide name. URLs have three parts: the proto-
col (also known as the scheme), the DNS name of the machine on which the page
is located, and the path uniquely indicating the specific page (a file to read or pro-
gram to run on the machine). In the general case, the path has a hierarchical name
that models a file directory structure. However, the interpretation of the path is up
to the server; it may or may not reflect the actual directory structure.
As an example, the URL of the page shown in Fig. 7-18 is
http://www.cs.washington.edu/index.html
This URL consists of three parts: the protocol (http), the DNS name of the host
(www.cs.washington.edu), and the path name (index.html).
When a user clicks on a hyperlink, the browser carries out a series of steps in
order to fetch the page pointed to. Let us trace the steps that occur when our ex-
ample link is selected:
1. The browser determines the URL (by seeing what was selected).
2. The
browser
asks
DNS
for
the
IP
address
of

server
www.cs.washington.edu.
3. DNS replies with 128.208.3.88.
4. The browser makes a TCP connection to 128.208.3.88 on port 80, the
well-known port for the HTTP protocol.
5. It sends over an HTTP request asking for the page /index.html.

---

## Page 41

SEC. 7.3
THE WORLD WIDE WEB
651
6. The www.cs.washington.edu server sends the page as an HTTP re-
sponse, for example, by sending the file /index.html.
7. If the page includes URLs that are needed for display, the browser
fetches the other URLs using the same process. In this case, the
URLs
include
multiple
embedded
images
also
fetched
from
www.cs.washington.edu, an embedded video from youtube.com, and
a script from google-analytics.com.
8. The browser displays the page /index.html as it appears in Fig. 7-18.
9. The TCP connections are released if there are no other requests to
the same servers for a short period.
Many browsers display which step they are currently executing in a status line
at the bottom of the screen. In this way, when the performance is poor, the user
can see if it is due to DNS not responding, a server not responding, or simply page
transmission over a slow or congested network.
The URL design is open-ended in the sense that it is straightforward to have
browsers use multiple protocols to get at different kinds of resources. In fact,
URLs for various other protocols have been defined. Slightly simplified forms of
the common ones are listed in Fig. 7-19.

Let us briefly go over the list. The http protocol is the Web’s native language,
the one spoken by Web servers. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Proto-
col. We will examine it in more detail later in this section.
The ftp protocol is used to access files by FTP, the Internet’s file transfer pro-
tocol. FTP predates the Web and has been in use for more than three decades.
The Web makes it easy to obtain files placed on numerous FTP servers
throughout the world by providing a simple, clickable interface instead of a com-
mand-line interface. This improved access to information is one reason for the
spectacular growth of the Web.

CHAP. 7
It is possible to access a local file as a Web page by using the file protocol, or
more simply, by just naming it. This approach does not require having a server.
Of course, it works only for local files, not remote ones.
The mailto protocol does not really have the flavor of fetching Web pages, but
is useful anyway. It allows users to send email from a Web browser. Most brow-
sers will respond when a mailto link is followed by starting the user’s mail agent
to compose a message with the address field already filled in.
The rtsp and sip protocols are for establishing streaming media sessions and
audio and video calls.
Finally, the about protocol is a convention that provides information about the
browser. For example, following the about:plugins link will cause most browsers
to show a page that lists the MIME types that they handle with browser extensions
called plug-ins.
In short, the URLs have been designed not only to allow users to navigate the
Web, but to run older protocols such as FTP and email as well as newer protocols
for audio and video, and to provide convenient access to local files and browser
information. This approach makes all the specialized user interface programs for
those other services unnecessary and integrates nearly all Internet access into a
single program: the Web browser. If it were not for the fact that this idea was
thought of by a British physicist working a research lab in Switzerland, it could
easily pass for a plan dreamed up by some software company’s advertising depart-
ment.
Despite all these nice properties, the growing use of the Web has turned up an
inherent weakness in the URL scheme. A URL points to one specific host, but
sometimes it is useful to reference a page without simultaneously telling where it
is. For example, for pages that are heavily referenced, it is desirable to have mul-
tiple copies far apart, to reduce the network traffic. There is no way to say: ‘‘I
want page xyz, but I do not care where you get it.’’
To solve this kind of problem, URLs have been generalized into URIs (Uni-
form Resource Identifiers). Some URIs tell how to locate a resource. These are
the URLs. Other URIs tell the name of a resource but not where to find it. These
URIs are called URNs (Uniform Resource Names). The rules for writing URIs
are given in RFC 3986, while the different URI schemes in use are tracked by
IANA. There are many different kinds of URIs besides the schemes listed in
Fig. 7-19, but those schemes dominate the Web as it is used today.
MIME Types
To be able to display the new page (or any page), the browser has to under-
stand its format. To allow all browsers to understand all Web pages, Web pages
are written in a standardized language called HTML. It is the lingua franca of the
Web (for now). We will discuss it in detail later in this chapter.

Although a browser is basically an HTML interpreter, most browsers have
numerous buttons and features to make it easier to navigate the Web. Most have a
button for going back to the previous page, a button for going forward to the next
page (only operative after the user has gone back from it), and a button for going
straight to the user’s preferred start page. Most browsers have a button or menu
item to set a bookmark on a given page and another one to display the list of
bookmarks, making it possible to revisit any of them with only a few mouse
clicks.
As our example shows, HTML pages can contain rich content elements and
not simply text and hypertext. For added generality, not all pages need contain
HTML. A page may consist of a video in MPEG format, a document in PDF for-
mat, a photograph in JPEG format, a song in MP3 format, or any one of hundreds
of other file types. Since standard HTML pages may link to any of these, the
browser has a problem when it hits a page it does not know how to interpret.
Rather than making the browsers larger and larger by building in interpreters
for a rapidly growing collection of file types, most browsers have chosen a more
general solution. When a server returns a page, it also returns some additional
information about the page. This information includes the MIME type of the page
(see Fig. 7-13). Pages of type text/html are just displayed directly, as are pages in
a few other built-in types. If the MIME type is not one of the built-in ones, the
browser consults its table of MIME types to determine how to display the page.
This table associates MIME types with viewers.
There are two possibilities: plug-ins and helper applications. A plug-in is a
third-party code module that is installed as an extension to the browser, as illus-
trated in Fig. 7-20(a). Common examples are plug-ins for PDF, Flash, and Quick-
time to render documents and play audio and video. Because plug-ins run inside
the browser, they have access to the current page and can modify its appearance.

Each browser has a set of procedures that all plug-ins must implement so the
browser can call the plug-ins. For example, there is typically a procedure the

---

## Page 44

654
THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
browser’s base code calls to supply the plug-in with data to display. This set of
procedures is the plug-in’s interface and is browser specific.
In addition, the browser makes a set of its own procedures available to the
plug-in, to provide services to plug-ins. Typical procedures in the browser inter-
face are for allocating and freeing memory, displaying a message on the browser’s
status line, and querying the browser about parameters.
Before a plug-in can be used, it must be installed. The usual installation pro-
cedure is for the user to go to the plug-in’s Web site and download an installation
file. Executing the installation file unpacks the plug-in and makes the appropriate
calls to register the plug-in’s MIME type with the browser and associate the
plug-in with it. Browsers usually come preloaded with popular plug-ins.
The other way to extend a browser is make use of a helper application. This
is a complete program, running as a separate process. It is illustrated in Fig. 7-
20(b). Since the helper is a separate program, the interface is at arm’s length from
the browser. It usually just accepts the name of a scratch file where the content
file has been stored, opens the file, and displays the contents. Typically, helpers
are large programs that exist independently of the browser, for example, Micro-
soft Word or PowerPoint.
Many helper applications use the MIME type application. As a consequence,
a considerable number of subtypes have been defined for them to use, for exam-
ple, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint for PowerPoint files. vnd denotes vendor-spe-
cific formats. In this way, a URL can point directly to a PowerPoint file, and
when the user clicks on it, PowerPoint is automatically started and handed the
content to be displayed. Helper applications are not restricted to using the appli-
cation MIME type.. Adobe Photoshop uses image/x-photoshop, for example.
Consequently, browsers can be configured to handle a virtually unlimited
number of document types with no changes to themselves. Modern Web servers
are often configured with hundreds of type/subtype combinations and new ones
are often added every time a new program is installed.
A source of conflicts is that multiple plug-ins and helper applications are
available for some subtypes, such as video/mpeg. What happens is that the last
one to register overwrites the existing association with the MIME type, capturing
the type for itself. As a consequence, installing a new program may change the
way a browser handles existing types.
Browsers can also open local files, with no network in sight, rather than fetch-
ing them from remote Web servers. However, the browser needs some way to de-
termine the MIME type of the file. The standard method is for the operating sys-
tem to associate a file extension with a MIME type. In a typical configuration,
opening foo.pdf will open it in the browser using an application/pdf plug-in and
opening bar.doc will open it in Word as the application/msword helper.
Here, too, conflicts can arise, since many programs are willing—no, make
that eager—to handle, say, mpg.
During installation, programs intended for
sophisticated users often display checkboxes for the MIME types and extensions

---

## Page 45

SEC. 7.3
THE WORLD WIDE WEB
655
they are prepared to handle to allow the user to select the appropriate ones and
thus not overwrite existing associations by accident. Programs aimed at the con-
sumer market assume that the user does not have a clue what a MIME type is and
simply grab everything they can without regard to what previously installed pro-
grams have done.
The ability to extend the browser with a large number of new types is con-
venient but can also lead to trouble. When a browser on a Windows PC fetches a
file with the extension exe, it realizes that this file is an executable program and
therefore has no helper. The obvious action is to run the program. However, this
could be an enormous security hole. All a malicious Web site has to do is pro-
duce a Web page with pictures of, say, movie stars or sports heroes, all of which
are linked to a virus. A single click on a picture then causes an unknown and po-
tentially hostile executable program to be fetched and run on the user’s machine.
To prevent unwanted guests like this, Firefox and other browsers come configured
to be cautious about running unknown programs automatically, but not all users
understand what choices are safe rather than convenient.
The Server Side
So much for the client side. Now let us take a look at the server side. As we
saw above, when the user types in a URL or clicks on a line of hypertext, the
browser parses the URL and interprets the part between http:// and the next slash
as a DNS name to look up. Armed with the IP address of the server, the browser
establishes a TCP connection to port 80 on that server. Then it sends over a com-
mand containing the rest of the URL, which is the path to the page on that server.
The server then returns the page for the browser to display.
To a first approximation, a simple Web server is similar to the server of
Fig. 6-6. That server is given the name of a file to look up and return via the net-
work. In both cases, the steps that the server performs in its main loop are:
1. Accept a TCP connection from a client (a browser).
2. Get the path to the page, which is the name of the file requested.
3. Get the file (from disk).
4. Send the contents of the file to the client.
5. Release the TCP connection.
Modern Web servers have more features, but in essence, this is what a Web server
does for the simple case of content that is contained in a file. For dynamic con-
tent, the third step may be replaced by the execution of a program (determined
from the path) that returns the contents.
However, Web servers are implemented with a different design to serve many
requests per second. One problem with the simple design is that accessing files is

---

## Page 46

656
THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
often the bottleneck. Disk reads are very slow compared to program execution,
and the same files may be read repeatedly from disk using operating system calls.
Another problem is that only one request is processed at a time. The file may be
large, and other requests will be blocked while it is transferred.
One obvious improvement (used by all Web servers) is to maintain a cache in
memory of the n most recently read files or a certain number of gigabytes of con-
tent. Before going to disk to get a file, the server checks the cache. If the file is
there, it can be served directly from memory, thus eliminating the disk access.
Although effective caching requires a large amount of main memory and some
extra processing time to check the cache and manage its contents, the savings in
time are nearly always worth the overhead and expense.
To tackle the problem of serving a single request at a time, one strategy is to
make the server multithreaded. In one design, the server consists of a front-end
module that accepts all incoming requests and k processing modules, as shown in
Fig. 7-21. The k + 1 threads all belong to the same process, so the processing
modules all have access to the cache within the process’ address space. When a
request comes in, the front end accepts it and builds a short record describing it.
It then hands the record to one of the processing modules.

Figure 7-21. A multithreaded Web server with a front end and processing modules.
The processing module first checks the cache to see if the file needed is there.
If so, it updates the record to include a pointer to the file in the record. If it is not
there, the processing module starts a disk operation to read it into the cache (pos-
sibly discarding some other cached file(s) to make room for it). When the file
comes in from the disk, it is put in the cache and also sent back to the client.
The advantage of this scheme is that while one or more processing modules
are blocked waiting for a disk or network operation to complete (and thus con-
suming no CPU time), other modules can be actively working on other requests.
With k processing modules, the throughput can be as much as k times higher than
with a single-threaded server. Of course, when the disk or network is the limiting

657
factor, it is necessary to have multiple disks or a faster network to get any real im-
provement over the single-threaded model.
Modern Web servers do more than just accept path names and return files. In
fact, the actual processing of each request can get quite complicated. For this rea-
son, in many servers each processing module performs a series of steps. The front
end passes each incoming request to the first available module, which then carries
it out using some subset of the following steps, depending on which ones are
needed for that particular request. These steps occur after the TCP connection
and any secure transport mechanism (such as SSL/TLS, which will be described
in Chap. 8) have been established.
1. Resolve the name of the Web page requested.
2. Perform access control on the Web page.
3. Check the cache.
4. Fetch the requested page from disk or run a program to build it.
5. Determine the rest of the response (e.g., the MIME type to send).
6. Return the response to the client.
7. Make an entry in the server log.
Step 1 is needed because the incoming request may not contain the actual name of
a file or program as a literal string. It may contain built-in shortcuts that need to
be translated. As a simple example, the URL http://www.cs.vu.nl/ has an empty
file name.
It has to be expanded to some default file name that is usually
index.html. Another common rule is to map ~user/ onto user’s Web directory.
These rules can be used together. Thus, the home page of one of the authors
(AST) can be reached at
http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/
even though the actual file name is index.html in a certain default directory.
Also, modern browsers can specify configuration information such as the
browser software and the user’s default language (e.g., Italian or English). This
makes it possible for the server to select a Web page with small pictures for a
mobile device and in the preferred language, if available. In general, name expan-
sion is not quite so trivial as it might at first appear, due to a variety of conven-
tions about how to map paths to the file directory and programs.
Step 2 checks to see if any access restrictions associated with the page are
met. Not all pages are available to the general public. Determining whether a cli-
ent can fetch a page may depend on the identity of the client (e.g., as given by
usernames and passwords) or the location of the client in the DNS or IP space.

accomplished depends on the design of the server. For the popular Apache server,
for instance, the convention is to place a file called .htaccess that lists the access
restrictions in the directory where the restricted page is located.
Steps 3 and 4 involve getting the page. Whether it can be taken from the
cache depends on processing rules. For example, pages that are created by run-
ning programs cannot always be cached because they might produce a different
result each time they are run. Even files should occasionally be checked to see if
their contents have changed so that the old contents can be removed from the
cache. If the page requires a program to be run, there is also the issue of setting
the program parameters or input. These data come from the path or other parts of
the request.
Step 5 is about determining other parts of the response that accompany the
contents of the page. The MIME type is one example. It may come from the file
extension, the first few words of the file or program output, a configuration file,
and possibly other sources.
Step 6 is returning the page across the network. To increase performance, a
single TCP connection may be used by a client and server for multiple page
fetches. This reuse means that some logic is needed to map a request to a shared
connection and to return each response so that it is associated with the correct re-
quest.
Step 7 makes an entry in the system log for administrative purposes, along
with keeping any other important statistics. Such logs can later be mined for valu-
able information about user behavior, for example, the order in which people ac-
cess the pages.
Cookies
Navigating the Web as we have described it so far involves a series of inde-
pendent page fetches. There is no concept of a login session. The browser sends
a request to a server and gets back a file. Then the server forgets that it has ever
seen that particular client.
This model is perfectly adequate for retrieving publicly available documents,
and it worked well when the Web was first created. However, it is not suited for
returning different pages to different users depending on what they have already
done with the server. This behavior is needed for many ongoing interactions with
Web sites. For example, some Web sites (e.g., newspapers) require clients to reg-
ister (and possibly pay money) to use them. This raises the question of how ser-
vers can distinguish between requests from users who have previously registered
and everyone else. A second example is from e-commerce. If a user wanders
around an electronic store, tossing items into her virtual shopping cart from time
to time, how does the server keep track of the contents of the cart? A third ex-
ample is customized Web portals such as Yahoo!. Users can set up a personalized

detailed initial page with only the information they want (e.g., their stocks and
their favorite sports teams), but how can the server display the correct page if it
does not know who the user is?
At first glance, one might think that servers could track users by observing
their IP addresses. However, this idea does not work. Many users share com-
puters, especially at home, and the IP address merely identifies the computer, not
the user. Even worse, many companies use NAT, so that outgoing packets bear
the same IP address for all users. That is, all of the computers behind the NAT
box look the same to the server. And many ISPs assign IP addresses to customers
with DHCP. The IP addresses change over time, so to a server you might sudden-
ly look like your neighbor. For all of these reasons, the server cannot use IP ad-
dresses to track users.
This problem is solved with an oft-critized mechanism called cookies. The
name derives from ancient programmer slang in which a program calls a proce-
dure and gets something back that it may need to present later to get some work
done. In this sense, a UNIX file descriptor or a Windows object handle can be
considered to be a cookie. Cookies were first implemented in the Netscape brow-
ser in 1994 and are now specified in RFC 2109.
When a client requests a Web page, the server can supply additional infor-
mation in the form of a cookie along with the requested page. The cookie is a
rather small, named string (of at most 4 KB) that the server can associate with a
browser. This association is not the same thing as a user, but it is much closer and
more useful than an IP address. Browsers store the offered cookies for an inter-
val, usually in a cookie directory on the client’s disk so that the cookies persist a-
cross browser invocations, unless the user has disabled cookies. Cookies are just
strings, not executable programs. In principle, a cookie could contain a virus, but
since cookies are treated as data, there is no official way for the virus to actually
run and do damage. However, it is always possible for some hacker to exploit a
browser bug to cause activation.
A cookie may contain up to five fields, as shown in Fig. 7-22. The Domain
tells where the cookie came from. Browsers are supposed to check that servers
are not lying about their domain. Each domain should store no more than 20
cookies per client. The Path is a path in the server’s directory structure that iden-
tifies which parts of the server’s file tree may use the cookie. It is often /, which
means the whole tree.
The Content field takes the form name = value. Both name and value can be
anything the server wants. This field is where the cookie’s content is stored.
The Expires field specifies when the cookie expires. If this field is absent, the
browser discards the cookie when it exits. Such a cookie is called a nonper-
sistent cookie. If a time and date are supplied, the cookie is said to be a per-
sistent cookie and is kept until it expires.
Expiration times are given in
Greenwich Mean Time. To remove a cookie from a client’s hard disk, a server
just sends it again, but with an expiration time in the past.

Figure 7-22. Some examples of cookies.
Finally, the Secure field can be set to indicate that the browser may only re-
turn the cookie to a server using a secure transport, namely SSL/TLS (which we
will describe in Chap. 8). This feature is used for e-commerce, banking, and other
secure applications.
We have now seen how cookies are acquired, but how are they used? Just be-
fore a browser sends a request for a page to some Web site, it checks its cookie di-
rectory to see if any cookies there were placed by the domain the request is going
to. If so, all the cookies placed by that domain, and only that domain, are in-
cluded in the request message. When the server gets them, it can interpret them
any way it wants to.
Let us examine some possible uses for cookies. In Fig. 7-22, the first cookie
was set by toms-casino.com and is used to identify the customer. When the client
returns next week to throw away some more money, the browser sends over the
cookie so the server knows who it is. Armed with the customer ID, the server can
look up the customer’s record in a database and use this information to build an
appropriate Web page to display. Depending on the customer’s known gambling
habits, this page might consist of a poker hand, a listing of today’s horse races, or
a slot machine.
The second cookie came from jills-store.com. The scenario here is that the
client is wandering around the store, looking for good things to buy. When she
finds a bargain and clicks on it, the server adds it to her shopping cart (maintained
on the server) and also builds a cookie containing the product code of the item and
sends the cookie back to the client. As the client continues to wander around the
store by clicking on new pages, the cookie is returned to the server on every new
page request. As more purchases accumulate, the server adds them to the cookie.
Finally, when the client clicks on PROCEED TO CHECKOUT, the cookie, now con-
taining the full list of purchases, is sent along with the request. In this way, the
server knows exactly what the customer wants to buy.
The third cookie is for a Web portal. When the customer clicks on a link to
the portal, the browser sends over the cookie. This tells the portal to build a page
containing the stock prices for Cisco and Oracle, and the New York Jets’ football
results. Since a cookie can be up to 4 KB, there is plenty of room for more detail-
ed preferences concerning newspaper headlines, local weather, special offers, etc.

A more controversial use of cookies is to track the online behavior of users.
This lets Web site operators understand how users navigate their sites, and
advertisers build up profiles of the ads or sites a particular user has viewed. The
controversy is that users are typically unaware that their activity is being tracked,
even with detailed profiles and across seemingly unrelated Web sites. Nonethe-
less, Web tracking is big business. DoubleClick, which provides and tracks ads,
is ranked among the 100 busiest Web sites in the world by the Web monitoring
company Alexa. Google Analytics, which tracks site usage for operators, is used
by more than half of the busiest 100,000 sites on the Web.
It is easy for a server to track user activity with cookies. Suppose a server
wants to keep track of how many unique visitors it has had and how many pages
each visitor looked at before leaving the site. When the first request comes in,
there will be no accompanying cookie, so the server sends back a cookie con-
taining Counter = 1. Subsequent page views on that site will send the cookie
back to the server. Each time the counter is incremented and sent back to the cli-
ent. By keeping track of the counters, the server can see how many people give
up after seeing the first page, how many look at two pages, and so on.
Tracking the browsing behavior of users across sites is only slightly more
complicated. It works like this. An advertising agency, say, Sneaky Ads, con-
tacts major Web sites and places ads for its clients’ products on their pages, for
which it pays the site owners a fee. Instead, of giving the sites the ad as a GIF file
to place on each page, it gives them a URL to add to each page. Each URL it
hands out contains a unique number in the path, such as
http://www.sneaky.com/382674902342.gif
When a user first visits a page, P, containing such an ad, the browser fetches
the HTML file. Then the browser inspects the HTML file and sees the link to the
image file at www.sneaky.com, so it sends a request there for the image. A GIF
file containing an ad is returned, along with a cookie containing a unique user ID,
4627239101 in Fig. 7-22. Sneaky records the fact that the user with this ID
visited page P. This is easy to do since the path requested (382674902342.gif) is
referenced only on page P. Of course, the actual ad may appear on thousands of
pages, but each time with a different name. Sneaky probably collects a fraction of
a penny from the product manufacturer each time it ships out the ad.
Later, when the user visits another Web page containing any of Sneaky’s ads,
the browser first fetches the HTML file from the server. Then it sees the link to,
say, http://www.sneaky.com/193654919923.gif on the page and requests that file.
Since it already has a cookie from the domain sneaky.com, the browser includes
Sneaky’s cookie containing the user’s ID. Sneaky now knows a second page the
user has visited.
In due course, Sneaky can build up a detailed profile of the user’s browsing
habits, even though the user has never clicked on any of the ads. Of course, it
does not yet have the user’s name (although it does have his IP address, which

CHAP. 7
may be enough to deduce the name from other databases). However, if the user
ever supplies his name to any site cooperating with Sneaky, a complete profile
along with a name will be available for sale to anyone who wants to buy it. The
sale of this information may be profitable enough for Sneaky to place more ads on
more Web sites and thus collect more information.
And if Sneaky wants to be supersneaky, the ad need not be a classical banner
ad. An ‘‘ad’’ consisting of a single pixel in the background color (and thus invisi-
ble) has exactly the same effect as a banner ad: it requires the browser to go fetch
the 1 × 1-pixel GIF image and send it all cookies originating at the pixel’s do-
main.
Cookies have become a focal point for the debate over online privacy because
of tracking behavior like the above. The most insidious part of the whole business
is that many users are completely unaware of this information collection and may
even think they are safe because they do not click on any of the ads. For this rea-
son, cookies that track users across sites are considered by many to be spyware.
Have a look at the cookies that are already stored by your browser. Most brow-
sers will display this information along with the current privacy preferences. You
might be surprised to find names, email addresses, or passwords as well as opaque
identifiers. Hopefully, you will not find credit card numbers, but the potential for
abuse is clear.
To maintain a semblance of privacy, some users configure their browsers to
reject all cookies. However, this can cause problems because many Web sites
will not work properly without cookies. Alternatively, most browsers let users
block third-party cookies. A third-party cookie is one from a different site than
the main page that is being fetched, for example, the sneaky.com cookie that is
used when interacting with page P on a completely different Web site. Blocking
these cookies helps to prevent tracking across Web sites. Browser extensions can
also be installed to provide fine-grained control over how cookies are used (or,
rather, not used). As the debate continues, many companies are developing priva-
cy policies that limit how they will share information to prevent abuse. Of course,
the policies are simply how the companies say they will handle information. For
example: ‘‘We may use the information collected from you in the conduct of our
business’’—which might be selling the information.
7.3.2 Static Web Pages
The basis of the Web is transferring Web pages from server to client. In the
simplest form, Web pages are static. That is, they are just files sitting on some
server that present themselves in the same way each time they are fetched and
viewed. Just because they are static does not mean that the pages are inert at the
browser, however. A page containing a video can be a static Web page.
As mentioned earlier, the lingua franca of the Web, in which most pages are
written, is HTML. The home pages of teachers are usually static HTML pages.

The home pages of companies are usually dynamic pages put together by a Web
design company. In this section, we will take a brief look at static HTML pages
as a foundation for later material. Readers already familiar with HTML can skip
ahead to the next section, where we describe dynamic content and Web services.
HTML—The HyperText Markup Language
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was introduced with the Web. It
allows users to produce Web pages that include text, graphics, video, pointers to
other Web pages, and more. HTML is a markup language, or language for
describing how documents are to be formatted. The term ‘‘markup’’ comes from
the old days when copyeditors actually marked up documents to tell the printer—
in those days, a human being—which fonts to use, and so on. Markup languages
thus contain explicit commands for formatting. For example, in HTML, <b>
means start boldface mode, and </b> means leave boldface mode. LaTeX and
TeX are other examples of markup languages that are well known to most
academic authors.
The key advantage of a markup language over one with no explicit markup is
that it separates content from how it should be presented. Writing a browser is
then straightforward: the browser simply has to understand the markup commands
and apply them to the content. Embedding all the markup commands within each
HTML file and standardizing them makes it possible for any Web browser to read
and reformat any Web page. That is crucial because a page may have been pro-
duced in a 1600 × 1200 window with 24-bit color on a high-end computer but may
have to be displayed in a 640 × 320 window on a mobile phone.
While it is certainly possible to write documents like this with any plain text
editor, and many people do, it is also possible to use word processors or special
HTML editors that do most of the work (but correspondingly give the user less
direct control over the details of the final result).
A simple Web page written in HTML and its presentation in a browser are
given in Fig. 7-23. A Web page consists of a head and a body, each enclosed by
<html> and </html> tags (formatting commands), although most browsers do not
complain if these tags are missing. As can be seen in Fig. 7-23(a), the head is
bracketed by the <head> and </head> tags and the body is bracketed by the
<body> and </body> tags. The strings inside the tags are called directives. Most,
but not all, HTML tags have this format. That is, they use <something> to mark
the beginning of something and </something> to mark its end.
Tags can be in either lowercase or uppercase. Thus, <head> and <HEAD>
mean the same thing, but lower case is best for compatibility. Actual layout of the
HTML document is irrelevant. HTML parsers ignore extra spaces and carriage
returns since they have to reformat the text to make it fit the current display area.
Consequently, white space can be added at will to make HTML documents more

readable, something most of them are badly in need of. As another consequence,
blank lines cannot be used to separate paragraphs, as they are simply ignored. An
explicit tag is required.
Some tags have (named) parameters, called attributes. For example, the
<img> tag in Fig. 7-23 is used for including an image inline with the text. It has
two attributes, src and alt. The first attribute gives the URL for the image. The
HTML standard does not specify which image formats are permitted. In practice,
all browsers support GIF and JPEG files. Browsers are free to support other for-
mats, but this extension is a two-edged sword. If a user is accustomed to a brow-
ser that supports, say, TIFF files, he may include these in his Web pages and later
be surprised when other browsers just ignore all of his wonderful art.
The second attribute gives alternate text to use if the image cannot be dis-
played. For each tag, the HTML standard gives a list of what the permitted pa-
rameters, if any, are, and what they mean. Because each parameter is named, the
order in which the parameters are given is not significant.
Technically, HTML documents are written in the ISO 8859-1 Latin-1 charac-
ter set, but for users whose keyboards support only ASCII, escape sequences are
present for the special characters, such as e`. The list of special characters is given
in the standard. All of them begin with an ampersand and end with a semicolon.
For example, &nbsp; produces a space, &egrave; produces e` and &eacute; pro-
duces e´. Since <, >, and & have special meanings, they can be expressed only
with their escape sequences, &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;, respectively.
The main item in the head is the title, delimited by <title> and </title>. Certain
kinds of metainformation may also be present, though none are present in our ex-
ample. The title itself is not displayed on the page. Some browsers use it to label
the page’s window.
Several headings are used in Fig. 7-23. Each heading is generated by an <hn>
tag, where n is a digit in the range 1 to 6. Thus, <h1> is the most important head-
ing; <h6> is the least important one. It is up to the browser to render these ap-
propriately on the screen. Typically, the lower-numbered headings will be dis-
played in a larger and heavier font. The browser may also choose to use different
colors for each level of heading. Usually, <h1> headings are large and boldface
with at least one blank line above and below. In contrast, <h2> headings are in a
smaller font with less space above and below.
The tags <b> and <i> are used to enter boldface and italics mode, respectively.
The <hr> tag forces a break and draws a horizontal line across the display.
The <p> tag starts a paragraph. The browser might display this by inserting a
blank line and some indentation, for example. Interestingly, the </p> tag that
exists to mark the end of a paragraph is often omitted by lazy HTML pro-
grammers.
HTML provides various mechanisms for making lists, including nested lists.
Unordered lists, like the ones in Fig. 7-23 are started with <ul>, with <li> used to
mark the start of items. There is also an <ol> tag to starts an ordered list. The

individual items in unordered lists often appear with bullets ( ) in front of them.
Items in ordered lists are numbered by the browser.
Finally, we come to hyperlinks. Examples of these are seen in Fig. 7-23 using
the <a> (anchor) and </a> tags. The <a> tag has various parameters, the most im-
portant of which is href the linked URL. The text between the <a> and </a> is dis-
played. If it is selected, the hyperlink is followed to a new page. It is also permit-
ted to link other elements. For example, an image can be given between the <a>
and </a> tags using <img>. In this case, the image is displayed and clicking on it
activates the hyperlink.
There are many other HTML tags and attributes that we have not seen in this
simple example. For instance, the <a> tag can take a parameter name to plant a
hyperlink, allowing a hyperlink to point to the middle of a page. This is useful,
for example, for Web pages that start out with a clickable table of contents. By
clicking on an item in the table of contents, the user jumps to the corresponding
section of the same page. An example of a different tag is <br>. It forces the
browser to break and start a new line.
Probably the best way to understand tags is to look at them in action. To do
this, you can pick a Web page and look at the HTML in your browser to see how
the page was put together. Most browsers have a VIEW SOURCE menu item (or
something similar). Selecting this item displays the current page’s HTML source,
instead of its formatted output.
We have sketched the tags that have existed from the early Web. HTML
keeps evolving. Fig. 7-24 shows some of the features that have been added with
successive versions of HTML. HTML 1.0 refers to the version of HTML used
with the introduction of the Web. HTML versions 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 appeared in
rapid succession in the space of only a few years as the Web exploded. After
HTML 4.0, a period of almost ten years passed before the path to standarization
of the next major version, HTML 5.0, became clear. Because it is a major upgrade
that consolidates the ways that browsers handle rich content, the HTML 5.0 effort
is ongoing and not expected to produce a standard before 2012 at the earliest.
Standards notwithstanding, the major browsers already support HTML 5.0 func-
tionality.
The progression through HTML versions is all about adding new features that
people wanted but had to handle in nonstandard ways (e.g., plug-ins) until they
became standard. For example, HTML 1.0 and HTML 2.0 did not have tables.
They were added in HTML 3.0. An HTML table consists of one or more rows,
each consisting of one or more table cells that can contain a wide range of mater-
ial (e.g., text, images, other tables). Before HTML 3.0, authors needing a table
had to resort to ad hoc methods, such as including an image showing the table.
In HTML 4.0, more new features were added. These included accessibility
features for handicapped users, object embedding (a generalization of the <img>
tag so other objects can also be embedded in pages), support for scripting lan-
guages (to allow dynamic content), and more.

Figure 7-24. Some differences between HTML versions.
HTML 5.0 includes many features to handle the rich media that are now rou-
tinely used on the Web. Video and audio can be included in pages and played by
the browser without requiring the user to install plug-ins. Drawings can be built
up in the browser as vector graphics, rather than using bitmap image formats (like
JPEG and GIF) There is also more support for running scripts in browsers, such as
background threads of computation and access to storage. All of these features
help to support Web pages that are more like traditional applications with a user
interface than documents. This is the direction the Web is heading.
Input and Forms
There is one important capability that we have not discussed yet: input.
HTML 1.0 was basically one-way. Users could fetch pages from information pro-
viders, but it was difficult to send information back the other way. It quickly
became apparent that there was a need for two-way traffic to allow orders for
products to be placed via Web pages, registration cards to be filled out online,
search terms to be entered, and much, much more.

Sending input from the user to the server (via the browser) requires two kinds
of support. First, it requires that HTTP be able to carry data in that direction. We
describe how this is done in a later section; it uses the POST method. The second
requirement is to be able to present user interface elements that gather and pack-
age up the input. Forms were included with this functionality in HTML 2.0.
Forms contain boxes or buttons that allow users to fill in information or make
choices and then send the information back to the page’s owner. Forms are writ-
ten just like other parts of HTML, as seen in the example of Fig. 7-25. Note that
forms are still static content. They exhibit the same behavior regardless of who is
using them. Dynamic content, which we will cover later, provides more sophisti-
cated ways to gather input by sending a program whose behavior may depend on
the browser environment.
Like all forms, this one is enclosed between the <form> and </form> tags. The
attributes of this tag tell what to do with the data that are input, in this case using
the POST method to send the data to the specified URL. Text not enclosed in a
tag is just displayed. All the usual tags (e.g., <b>) are allowed in a form to let the
author of the page control the look of the form on the screen.
Three kinds of input boxes are used in this form, each of which uses the
<input> tag. It has a variety of parameters for determining the size, nature, and
usage of the box displayed. The most common forms are blank fields for ac-
cepting user text, boxes that can be checked, and submit buttons that cause the
data to be returned to the server.
The first kind of input box is a text box that follows the text ‘‘Name’’. The
box is 46 characters wide and expects the user to type in a string, which is then
stored in the variable customer.
The next line of the form asks for the user’s street address, 40 characters
wide. Then comes a line asking for the city, state, and country. Since no <p> tags
are used between these fields, the browser displays them all on one line (instead
of as separate paragraphs) if they will fit. As far as the browser is concerned, the
one paragraph contains just six items: three strings alternating with three boxes.
The next line asks for the credit card number and expiration date. Transmitting
credit card numbers over the Internet should only be done when adequate security
measures have been taken. We will discuss some of these in Chap. 8.
Following the expiration date, we encounter a new feature: radio buttons.
These are used when a choice must be made among two or more alternatives. The
intellectual model here is a car radio with half a dozen buttons for choosing sta-
tions. Clicking on one button turns off all the other ones in the same group. The
visual presentation is up to the browser. Widget size also uses two radio buttons.
The two groups are distinguished by their name parameter, not by static scoping
using something like <radiobutton> ... </radiobutton>.
The value parameters are used to indicate which radio button was pushed.
For example, depending on which credit card options the user has chosen, the
variable cc will be set to either the string ‘‘mastercard’’ or the string ‘‘visacard’’.

After the two sets of radio buttons, we come to the shipping option, repres-
ented by a box of type checkbox. It can be either on or off. Unlike radio buttons,
where exactly one out of the set must be chosen, each box of type checkbox can
be on or off, independently of all the others.

Finally, we come to the submit button. The value string is the label on the
button and is displayed. When the user clicks the submit button, the browser
packages the collected information into a single long line and sends it back to the
server to the URL provided as part of the <form> tag. A simple encoding is used.
The & is used to separate fields and + is used to represent space. For our example
form, the line might look like the contents of Fig. 7-26.
customer=John+Doe&address=100+Main+St.&city=White+Plains&
state=NY&country=USA&cardno=1234567890&expires=6/14&cc=mastercard&
product=cheap&express=on
Figure 7-26. A possible response from the browser to the server with infor-
mation filled in by the user.
The string is sent back to the server as one line. (It is broken into three lines here
because the page is not wide enough.) It is up to the server to make sense of this
string, most likely by passing the information to a program that will process it.
We will discuss how this can be done in the next section.
There are also other types of input that are not shown in this simple example.
Two other types are password and textarea. A password box is the same as a text
box (the default type that need not be named), except that the characters are not
displayed as they are typed. A textarea box is also the same as a text box, except
that it can contain multiple lines.
For long lists from which a choice must be made, the <select> and </select>
tags are provided to bracket a list of alternatives. This list is often rendered as a
drop-down menu. The semantics are those of radio buttons unless the multiple pa-
rameter is given, in which case the semantics are those of checkboxes.
Finally, there are ways to indicate default or initial values that the user can
change. For example, if a text box is given a value field, the contents are dis-
played in the form for the user to edit or erase.
CSS—Cascading Style Sheets
The original goal of HTML was to specify the structure of the document, not
its appearance. For example,
<h1> Deborah’s Photos </h1>
instructs the browser to emphasize the heading, but does not say anything about
the typeface, point size, or color. That is left up to the browser, which knows the
properties of the display (e.g., how many pixels it has). However, many Web
page designers wanted absolute control over how their pages appeared, so new
tags were added to HTML to control appearance, such as
<font face="helvetica" size="24" color="red"> Deborah’s Photos </font>

---

Also, ways were added to control positioning on the screen accurately. The trou-
ble with this approach is that it is tedious and produces bloated HTML that is not
portable. Although a page may render perfectly in the browser it is developed on,
it may be a complete mess in another browser or another release of the same
browser or at a different screen resolution.
A better alternative is the use of style sheets. Style sheets in text editors allow
authors to associate text with a logical style instead of a physical style, for ex-
ample, ‘‘initial paragraph’’ instead of ‘‘italic text.’’ The appearance of each style
is defined separately. In this way, if the author decides to change the initial para-
graphs from 14-point italics in blue to 18-point boldface in shocking pink, all it re-
quires is changing one definition to convert the entire document.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) introduced style sheets to the Web with
HTML 4.0, though widespread use and browser support did not take off until
2000. CSS defines a simple language for describing rules that control the appear-
ance of tagged content. Let us look at an example. Suppose that AWI wants
snazzy Web pages with navy text in the Arial font on an off-white background,
and level headings that are an extra 100% and 50% larger than the text for each
level, respectively. The CSS definition in Fig. 7-27 gives these rules.
body {background-color:linen; color:navy; font-family:Arial;}
h1 {font-size:200%;}
h2 {font-size:150%;}
Figure 7-27. CSS example.
As can be seen, the style definitions can be compact. Each line selects an ele-
ment to which it applies and gives the values of properties. The properties of an
element apply as defaults to all other HTML elements that it contains. Thus, the
style for body sets the style for paragraphs of text in the body. There are also con-
venient shorthands for color names (e.g., red). Any style parameters that are not
defined are filled with defaults by the browser. This behavior makes style sheet
definitions optional; some reasonable presentation will occur without them.
Style sheets can be placed in an HTML file (e.g., using the <style> tag), but it
is more common to place them in a separate file and reference them. For example,
the <head> tag of the AWI page can be modified to refer to a style sheet in the
file awistyle.css as shown in Fig. 7-28. The example also shows the MIME type
of CSS files to be text/css.
<head>
<title> AMALGAMATED WIDGET, INC. </title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="awistyle.css" />
</head>

This strategy has two advantages. First, it lets one set of styles be applied to
many pages on a Web site. This organization lends a consistent appearance to
pages even if they were developed by different authors at different times, and al-
lows the look of the entire site to be changed by editing one CSS file and not the
HTML. This method can be compared to an #include file in a C program: chang-
ing one macro definition there changes it in all the program files that include the
header. The second advantage is that the HTML files that are downloaded are
kept small. This is because the browser can download one copy of the CSS file for
all pages that reference it. It does not need to download a new copy of the defini-
tions along with each Web page.
7.3.3 Dynamic Web Pages and Web Applications
The static page model we have used so far treats pages as multimedia docu-
ments that are conveniently linked together. It was a fitting model in the early
days of the Web, as vast amounts of information were put online. Nowadays,
much of the excitement around the Web is using it for applications and services.
Examples include buying products on e-commerce sites, searching library cata-
logs, exploring maps, reading and sending email, and collaborating on documents.
These new uses are like traditional application software (e.g., mail readers
and word processors). The twist is that these applications run inside the browser,
with user data stored on servers in Internet data centers. They use Web protocols
to access information via the Internet, and the browser to display a user interface.
The advantage of this approach is that users do not need to install separate appli-
cation programs, and user data can be accessed from different computers and
backed up by the service operator. It is proving so successful that it is rivaling
traditional application software. Of course, the fact that these applications are of-
fered for free by large providers helps. This model is the prevalent form of cloud
computing, in which computing moves off individual desktop computers and into
shared clusters of servers in the Internet.
To act as applications, Web pages can no longer be static. Dynamic content is
needed. For example, a page of the library catalog should reflect which books are
currently available and which books are checked out and are thus not available.
Similarly, a useful stock market page would allow the user to interact with the
page to see stock prices over different periods of time and compute profits and
losses. As these examples suggest, dynamic content can be generated by pro-
grams running on the server or in the browser (or in both places).
In this section, we will examine each of these two cases in turn. The general
situation is as shown in Fig. 7-29. For example, consider a map service that lets
the user enter a street address and presents a corresponding map of the location.
Given a request for a location, the Web server must use a program to create a
page that shows the map for the location from a database of streets and other geo-
graphic information. This action is shown as steps 1 through 3. The request (step

1) causes a program to run on the server. The program consults a database to gen-
erate the appropriate page (step 2) and returns it to the browser (step 3).

There is more to dynamic content, however. The page that is returned may it-
self contain programs that run in the browser. In our map example, the program
would let the user find routes and explore nearby areas at different levels of detail.
It would update the page, zooming in or out as directed by the user (step 4). To
handle some interactions, the program may need more data from the server. In
this case, the program will send a request to the server (step 5) that will retrieve
more information from the database (step 6) and return a response (step 7). The
program will then continue updating the page (step 4). The requests and responses
happen in the background; the user may not even be aware of them because the
page URL and title typically do not change. By including client-side programs,
the page can present a more responsive interface than with server-side programs
alone.
Server-Side Dynamic Web Page Generation
Let us look at the case of server-side content generation in more detail. A sim-
ple situation in which server-side processing is necessary is the use of forms.
Consider the user filling out the AWI order form of Fig. 7-25(b) and clicking the
Submit order button. When the user clicks, a request is sent to the server at the
URL specified with the form (a POST to http://widget.com/cgi-bin/order.cgi in
this case) along with the contents of the form as filled in by the user. These data
must be given to a program or script to process. Thus, the URL identifies the pro-
gram to run; the data are provided to the program as input. In this case, proc-
essing would involve entering the order in AWI’s internal system, updating custo-
mer records, and charging the credit card. The page returned by this request will
depend on what happens during the processing. It is not fixed like a static page. If
the order succeeds, the page returned might give the expected shipping date. If it
is unsuccessful, the returned page might say that widgets requested are out of
stock or the credit card was not valid for some reason.

Exactly how the server runs a program instead of retrieving a file depends on
the design of the Web server. It is not specified by the Web protocols themselves.
This is because the interface can be proprietary and the browser does not need to
know the details. As far as the browser is concerned, it is simply making a request
and fetching a page.
Nonetheless, standard APIs have been developed for Web servers to invoke
programs. The existence of these interfaces makes it easier for developers to ex-
tend different servers with Web applications. We will briefly look at two APIs to
give you a sense of what they entail.
The first API is a method for handling dynamic page requests that has been
available since the beginning of the Web. It is called the CGI (Common Gate-
way Interface) and is defined in RFC 3875. CGI provides an interface to allow
Web servers to talk to back-end programs and scripts that can accept input (e.g.,
from forms) and generate HTML pages in response. These programs may be
written in whatever language is convenient for the developer, usually a scripting
language for ease of development. Pick Python, Ruby, Perl or your favorite lan-
guage.
By convention, programs invoked via CGI live in a directory called cgi-bin,
which is visible in the URL. The server maps a request to this directory to a pro-
gram name and executes that program as a separate process. It provides any data
sent with the request as input to the program. The output of the program gives a
Web page that is returned to the browser.
In our example, the program order.cgi is invoked with input from the form en-
coded as shown in Fig. 7-26. It will parse the parameters and process the order. A
useful convention is that the program will return the HTML for the order form if
no form input is provided. In this way, the program will be sure to know the
representation of the form.
The second API we will look at is quite different. The approach here is to
embed little scripts inside HTML pages and have them be executed by the server
itself to generate the page. A popular language for writing these scripts is PHP
(PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor). To use it, the server has to understand PHP,
just as a browser has to understand CSS to interpret Web pages with style sheets.
Usually, servers identify Web pages containing PHP from the file extension php
rather than html or htm.
PHP is simpler to use than CGI. As an example of how it works with forms,
see the example in Fig. 7-30(a). The top part of this figure contains a normal
HTML page with a simple form in it. This time, the <form> tag specifies that ac-
tion.php is to be invoked to handle the parameters when the user submits the form.
The page displays two text boxes, one with a request for a name and one with a
request for an age. After the two boxes have been filled in and the form submit-
ted, the server parses the Fig. 7-26-type string sent back, putting the name in the
name variable and the age in the age variable. It then starts to process the ac-
tion.php file, shown in Fig. 7-30(b), as a reply. During the processing of this file,

the PHP commands are executed. If the user filled in ‘‘Barbara’’ and ‘‘24’’ in the
boxes, the HTML file sent back will be the one given in Fig. 7-30(c). Thus, han-
dling forms becomes extremely simple using PHP.
<html>
<body>
<form action="action.php" method="post">

Although PHP is easy to use, it is actually a powerful programming language
for interfacing the Web and a server database. It has variables, strings, arrays, and
most of the control structures found in C, but much more powerful I/O than just
printf. PHP is open source code, freely available, and widely used. It was de-
signed specifically to work well with Apache, which is also open source and is the
world’s most widely used Web server. For more information about PHP, see
Valade (2009).
We have now seen two different ways to generate dynamic HTML pages:
CGI scripts and embedded PHP. There are several others to choose from. JSP
(JavaServer Pages) is similar to PHP, except that the dynamic part is written in

the Java programming language instead of in PHP. Pages using this technique
have the file extension .jsp. ASP.NET (Active Server Pages .NET) is Micro-
soft’s version of PHP and JavaServer Pages. It uses programs written in Micro-
soft’s proprietary .NET networked application framework for generating the dy-
namic content. Pages using this technique have the extension .aspx. The choice
among these three techniques usually has more to do with politics (open source
vs. Microsoft) than with technology, since the three languages are roughly com-
parable.
Client-Side Dynamic Web Page Generation
PHP and CGI scripts solve the problem of handling input and interactions
with databases on the server. They can all accept incoming information from
forms, look up information in one or more databases, and generate HTML pages
with the results. What none of them can do is respond to mouse movements or
interact with users directly. For this purpose, it is necessary to have scripts em-
bedded in HTML pages that are executed on the client machine rather than the
server machine. Starting with HTML 4.0, such scripts are permitted using the tag
<script>. The technologies used to produce these interactive Web pages are
broadly referred to as dynamic HTML
The most popular scripting language for the client side is JavaScript, so we
will now take a quick look at it. Despite the similarity in names, JavaScript has
almost nothing to do with the Java programming language. Like other scripting
languages, it is a very high-level language. For example, in a single line of
JavaScript it is possible to pop up a dialog box, wait for text input, and store the
resulting string in a variable. High-level features like this make JavaScript ideal
for designing interactive Web pages. On the other hand, the fact that it is mutat-
ing faster than a fruit fly trapped in an X-ray machine makes it extremely difficult
to write JavaScript programs that work on all platforms, but maybe some day it
will stabilize.
As an example of a program in JavaScript, consider that of Fig. 7-31. Like
that of Fig. 7-30, it displays a form asking for a name and age, and then predicts
how old the person will be next year. The body is almost the same as the PHP ex-
ample, the main difference being the declaration of the Submit button and the
assignment statement in it. This assignment statement tells the browser to invoke
the response script on a button click and pass it the form as a parameter.
What is completely new here is the declaration of the JavaScript function re-
sponse in the head of the HTML file, an area normally reserved for titles, back-
ground colors, and so on. This function extracts the value of the name field from
the form and stores it in the variable person as a string. It also extracts the value
of the age field, converts it to an integer by using the eval function, adds 1 to it,
and stores the result in years. Then it opens a document for output, does four

writes to it using the writeln method, and closes the document. The document is
an HTML file, as can be seen from the various HTML tags in it. The browser
then displays the document on the screen.
It is very important to understand that while PHP and JavaScript look similar
in that they both embed code in HTML files, they are processed totally dif-
ferently. In the PHP example of Fig. 7-30, after the user has clicked on the submit
button, the browser collects the information into a long string and sends it off to
the server as a request for a PHP page. The server loads the PHP file and exe-
cutes the PHP script that is embedded in to produce a new HTML page. That page
is sent back to the browser for display. The browser cannot even be sure that it
was produced by a program. This processing is shown as steps 1 to 4 in Fig. 7-
32(a).
In the JavaScript example of Fig. 7-31, when the submit button is clicked the
browser interprets a JavaScript function contained on the page. All the work is
done locally, inside the browser. There is no contact with the server. This proc-
essing is shown as steps 1 and 2 in Fig. 7-32(b). As a consequence, the result is
displayed virtually instantaneously, whereas with PHP there can be a delay of sev-
eral seconds before the resulting HTML arrives at the client.

This difference does not mean that JavaScript is better than PHP. Their uses
are completely different. PHP (and, by implication, JSP and ASP) is used when
interaction with a database on the server is needed. JavaScript (and other client-
side languages we will mention, such as VBScript) is used when the interaction is
with the user at the client computer. It is certainly possible to combine them, as
we will see shortly.
JavaScript is not the only way to make Web pages highly interactive. An al-
ternative on Windows platforms is VBScript, which is based on Visual Basic.
Another popular method across platforms is the use of applets. These are small
Java programs that have been compiled into machine instructions for a virtual
computer called the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Applets can be embedded in
HTML pages (between <applet> and </applet>) and interpreted by JVM-capable
browsers. Because Java applets are interpreted rather than directly executed, the
Java interpreter can prevent them from doing Bad Things. At least in theory. In
practice, applet writers have found a nearly endless stream of bugs in the Java I/O
libraries to exploit.
Microsoft’s answer to Sun’s Java applets was allowing Web pages to hold
ActiveX controls, which are programs compiled to x86 machine language and ex-
ecuted on the bare hardware. This feature makes them vastly faster and more
flexible than interpreted Java applets because they can do anything a program can
do. When Internet Explorer sees an ActiveX control in a Web page, it downloads
it, verifies its identity, and executes it. However, downloading and running for-
eign programs raises enormous security issues, which we will discuss in Chap. 8.
Since nearly all browsers can interpret both Java programs and JavaScript, a
designer who wants to make a highly interactive Web page has a choice of at least
two techniques, and if portability to multiple platforms is not an issue, ActiveX in
addition. As a general rule, JavaScript programs are easier to write, Java applets
execute faster, and ActiveX controls run fastest of all. Also, since all browsers
implement exactly the same JVM but no two browsers implement the same ver-
sion of JavaScript, Java applets are more portable than JavaScript programs. For
more information about JavaScript, there are many books, each with many (often
with more than 1000) pages. See, for example, Flanagan (2010).

AJAX—Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
Compelling Web applications need responsive user interfaces and seamless
access to data stored on remote Web servers. Scripting on the client (e.g., with
JavaScript) and the server (e.g., with PHP) are basic technologies that provide
pieces of the solution. These technologies are commonly used with several other
key technologies in a combination called AJAX (Asynchronous JAvascript and
Xml). Many full-featured Web applications, such as Google’s Gmail, Maps, and
Docs, are written with AJAX.
AJAX is somewhat confusing because it is not a language. It is a set of tech-
nologies that work together to enable Web applications that are every bit as
responsive and powerful as traditional desktop applications. The technologies are:
1. HTML and CSS to present information as pages.
2. DOM (Document Object Model) to change parts of pages while they
are viewed.
3. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to let programs exchange ap-
plication data with the server.
4. An asynchronous way for programs to send and retrieve XML data.
5. JavaScript as a language to bind all this functionality together.
As this is quite a collection, we will go through each piece to see what it con-
tributes. We have already seen HTML and CSS. They are standards for describ-
ing content and how it should be displayed. Any program that can produce HTML
and CSS can use a Web browser as a display engine.
DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of an HTML page that
is accessible to programs. This representation is structured as a tree that reflects
the structure of the HTML elements. For instance, the DOM tree of the HTML in
Fig. 7-30(a) is given in Fig. 7-33. At the root is an html element that represents
the entire HTML block. This element is the parent of the body element, which is
in turn parent to a form element. The form has two attributes that are drawn to the
right-hand side, one for the form method (a POST ) and one for the form action
(the URL to request). This element has three children, reflecting the two para-
graph tags and one input tag that are contained within the form. At the bottom of
the tree are leaves that contain either elements or literals, such as text strings.
The significance of the DOM model is that it provides programs with a
straightforward way to change parts of the page. There is no need to rewrite the
entire page. Only the node that contains the change needs to be replaced. When
this change is made, the browser will correspondingly update the display. For ex-
ample, if an image on part of the page is changed in DOM, the browser will
update that image without changing the other parts of the page. We have already
seen DOM in action when the JavaScript example of Fig. 7-31 added lines to the

document element to cause new lines of text to appear at the bottom of the brow-
ser window. The DOM is a powerful method for producing pages that can evolve.
The third technology, XML (eXtensible Markup Language), is a language
for specifying structured content. HTML mixes content with formatting because
it is concerned with the presentation of information. However, as Web applica-
tions become more common, there is an increasing need to separate structured
content from its presentation. For example, consider a program that searches the
Web for the best price for some book. It needs to analyze many Web pages look-
ing for the item’s title and price. With Web pages in HTML, it is very difficult
for a program to figure out where the title is and where the price is.
For this reason, the W3C developed XML (Bray et al., 2006) to allow Web
content to be structured for automated processing. Unlike HTML, there are no
defined tags for XML. Each user can define her own tags. A simple example of
an XML document is given in Fig. 7-34. It defines a structure called book list,
which is a list of books. Each book has three fields, the title, author, and year of
publication. These structures are extremely simple. It is permitted to have struc-
tures with repeated fields (e.g., multiple authors), optional fields (e.g., URL of the
audio book), and alternative fields (e.g., URL of a bookstore if it is in print or
URL of an auction site if it is out of print).
In this example, each of the three fields is an indivisible entity, but it is also
permitted to further subdivide the fields. For example, the author field could have
been done as follows to give finer-grained control over searching and formatting:
<author>
<first name> George </first name>
<last name> Zipf </last name>
</author>
Each field can be subdivided into subfields and subsubfields, arbitrarily deeply.

Figure 7-34. A simple XML document.
All the file of Fig. 7-34 does is define a book list containing three books. It is
well suited for transporting information between programs running in browsers
and servers, but it says nothing about how to display the document as a Web page.
To do that, a program that consumes the information and judges 1949 to be a fine
year for books might output HTML in which the titles are marked up as italic text.
Alternatively, a language called XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Trans-
formations), can be used to define how XML should be transformed into HTML.
XSLT is like CSS, but much more powerful. We will spare you the details.
The other advantage of expressing data in XML, instead of HTML, is that it is
easier for programs to analyze. HTML was originally written manually (and often
is still) so a lot of it is a bit sloppy. Sometimes the closing tags, like </p>, are left
out. Other tags do not have a matching closing tag, like <br>. Still other tags may
be nested improperly, and the case of tag and attribute names can vary. Most
browsers do their best to work out what was probably intended. XML is stricter
and cleaner in its definition. Tag names and attributes are always lowercase, tags
must always be closed in the reverse of the order that they were opened (or indi-
cate clearly if they are an empty tag with no corresponding close), and attribute
values must be enclosed in quotation marks. This precision makes parsing easier
and unambiguous.
HTML is even being defined in terms of XML. This approach is called
XHTML (eXtended HyperText Markup Language). Basically, it is a Very

Picky version of HTML. XHTML pages must strictly conform to the XML rules,
otherwise they are not accepted by the browser. No more shoddy Web pages and
inconsistencies across browsers. As with XML, the intent is to produce pages that
are better for programs (in this case Web applications) to process.
While
XHTML has been around since 1998, it has been slow to catch on. People who
produce HTML do not see why they need XHTML, and browser support has
lagged. Now HTML 5.0 is being defined so that a page can be represented as ei-
ther HTML or XHTML to aid the transition. Eventually, XHTML should replace
HTML, but it will be a long time before this transition is complete.
XML has also proved popular as a language for communication between pro-
grams. When this communication is carried by the HTTP protocol (described in
the next section) it is called a Web service. In particular, SOAP (Simple Object
Access Protocol) is a way of implementing Web services that performs RPC be-
tween programs in a language- and system-independent way. The client just con-
structs the request as an XML message and sends it to the server, using the HTTP
protocol. The server sends back a reply as an XML-formatted message. In this
way, applications on heterogeneous platforms can communicate.
Getting back to AJAX, our point is simply that XML is a useful format to ex-
change data between programs running in the browser and the server. However,
to provide a responsive interface in the browser while sending or receiving data, it
must be possible for scripts to perform asynchronous I/O that does not block the
display while awaiting the response to a request. For example, consider a map
that can be scrolled in the browser. When it is notified of the scroll action, the
script on the map page may request more map data from the server if the view of
the map is near the edge of the data. The interface should not freeze while those
data are fetched. Such an interface would win no user awards. Instead, the scrol-
ling should continue smoothly. When the data arrive, the script is notified so that
it can use the data. If all goes well, new map data will be fetched before it is need-
ed. Modern browsers have support for this model of communication.
The final piece of the puzzle is a scripting language that holds AJAX together
by providing access to the above list of technologies. In most cases, this language
is JavaScript, but there are alternatives such as VBScript. We presented a simple
example of JavaScript earlier. Do not be fooled by this simplicity. JavaScript has
many quirks, but it is a full-blown programming language, with all the power of C
or Java. It has variables, strings, arrays, objects, functions, and all the usual con-
trol structures. It also has interfaces specific to the browser and Web pages.
JavaScript can track mouse motion over objects on the screen, which makes it
easy to make a menu suddenly appear and leads to lively Web pages. It can use
DOM to access pages, manipulate HTML and XML, and perform asynchronous
HTTP communication.
Before leaving the subject of dynamic pages, let us briefly summarize the
technologies we have covered so far by relating them on a single figure. Com-
plete Web pages can be generated on the fly by various scripts on the server

machine. The scripts can be written in server extension languages like PHP, JSP,
or ASP.NET, or run as separate CGI processes and thus be written in any lan-
guage. These options are shown in Fig. 7-35.

Figure 7-35. Various technologies used to generate dynamic pages.
Once these Web pages are received by the browser, they are treated as normal
pages in HTML, CSS and other MIME types and just displayed. Plug-ins that run
in the browser and helper applications that run outside of the browser can be in-
stalled to extend the MIME types that are supported by the browser.
Dynamic content generation is also possible on the client side. The programs
that are embedded in Web pages can be written in JavaScript, VBScript, Java, and
other languages. These programs can perform arbitrary computations and update
the display. With AJAX, programs in Web pages can asynchronously exchange
XML and other kinds of data with the server. This model supports rich Web appli-
cations that look just like traditional applications, except that they run inside the
browser and access information that is stored at servers on the Internet.
7.3.4 HTTP—The HyperText Transfer Protocol
Now that we have an understanding of Web content and applications, it is
time to look at the protocol that is used to transport all this information between
Web servers and clients. It is HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), as speci-
fied in RFC 2616.
HTTP is a simple request-response protocol that normally runs over TCP. It
specifies what messages clients may send to servers and what responses they get
back in return. The request and response headers are given in ASCII, just like in
SMTP. The contents are given in a MIME-like format, also like in SMTP. This
simple model was partly responsible for the early success of the Web because it
made development and deployment straightforward.
In this section, we will look at the more important properties of HTTP as it is
used nowadays. However, before getting into the details we will note that the way

---

## Page 74

it is used in the Internet is evolving. HTTP is an application layer protocol be-
cause it runs on top of TCP and is closely associated with the Web. That is why
we are covering it in this chapter. However, in another sense HTTP is becoming
more like a transport protocol that provides a way for processes to communicate
content across the boundaries of different networks. These processes do not have
to be a Web browser and Web server. A media player could use HTTP to talk to a
server and request album information. Antivirus software could use HTTP to
download the latest updates. Developers could use HTTP to fetch project files.
Consumer electronics products like digital photo frames often use an embedded
HTTP server as an interface to the outside world. Machine-to-machine communi-
cation increasingly runs over HTTP. For example, an airline server might use
SOAP (an XML RPC over HTTP) to contact a car rental server and make a car
reservation, all as part of a vacation package. These trends are likely to continue,
along with the expanding use of HTTP.
Connections
The usual way for a browser to contact a server is to establish a TCP con-
nection to port 80 on the server’s machine, although this procedure is not formally
required. The value of using TCP is that neither browsers nor servers have to
worry about how to handle long messages, reliability, or congestion control. All
of these matters are handled by the TCP implementation.
Early in the Web, with HTTP 1.0, after the connection was established a sin-
gle request was sent over and a single response was sent back. Then the TCP con-
nection was released. In a world in which the typical Web page consisted entirely
of HTML text, this method was adequate. Quickly, the average Web page grew
to contain large numbers of embedded links for content such as icons and other
eye candy. Establishing a separate TCP connection to transport each single icon
became a very expensive way to operate.
This observation led to HTTP 1.1, which supports persistent connections.
With them, it is possible to establish a TCP connection, send a request and get a
response, and then send additional requests and get additional responses. This
strategy is also called connection reuse. By amortizing the TCP setup, startup,
and release costs over multiple requests, the relative overhead due to TCP is re-
duced per request. It is also possible to pipeline requests, that is, send request 2
before the response to request 1 has arrived.
The performance difference between these three cases is shown in Fig. 7-36.
Part (a) shows three requests, one after the other and each in a separate con-
nection. Let us suppose that this represents a Web page with two embedded
images on the same server. The URLs of the images are determined as the main
page is fetched, so they are fetched after the main page. Nowadays, a typical
page has around 40 other objects that must be fetched to present it, but that would
make our figure far too big so we will use only two embedded objects.

A persistent connection and sequential requests. (c) A persistent connection and
pipelined requests.
In Fig. 7-36(b), the page is fetched with a persistent connection. That is, the
TCP connection is opened at the beginning, then the same three requests are sent,
one after the other as before, and only then is the connection closed. Observe that
the fetch completes more quickly. There are two reasons for the speedup. First,
time is not wasted setting up additional connections. Each TCP connection re-
quires at least one round-trip time to establish. Second, the transfer of the same
images proceeds more quickly. Why is this? It is because of TCP congestion con-
trol. At the start of a connection, TCP uses the slow-start procedure to increase the
throughput until it learns the behavior of the network path. The consequence of
this warmup period is that multiple short TCP connections take disproportionately
longer to transfer information than one longer TCP connection.
Finally, in Fig. 7-36(c), there is one persistent connection and the requests are
pipelined. Specifically, the second and third requests are sent in rapid succession
as soon as enough of the main page has been retrieved to identify that the images
must be fetched. The responses for these requests follow eventually. This method
cuts down the time that the server is idle, so it further improves performance.
Persistent connections do not come for free, however. A new issue that they
raise is when to close the connection. A connection to a server should stay open
while the page loads. What then? There is a good chance that the user will click
on a link that requests another page from the server. If the connection remains
open, the next request can be sent immediately. However, there is no guarantee
that the client will make another request of the server any time soon. In practice,

## Page 76

clients and servers usually keep persistent connections open until they have been
idle for a short time (e.g., 60 seconds) or they have a large number of open con-
nections and need to close some.
The observant reader may have noticed that there is one combination that we
have left out so far. It is also possible to send one request per TCP connection, but
run multiple TCP connections in parallel. This parallel connection method was
widely used by browsers before persistent connections. It has the same disadvan-
tage as sequential connections—extra overhead—but much better performance.
This is because setting up and ramping up the connections in parallel hides some
of the latency. In our example, connections for both of the embedded images
could be set up at the same time. However, running many TCP connections to the
same server is discouraged. The reason is that TCP performs congestion control
for each connection independently. As a consequence, the connections compete
against each other, causing added packet loss, and in aggregate are more aggres-
sive users of the network than an individual connection. Persistent connections are
superior and used in preference to parallel connections because they avoid over-
head and do not suffer from congestion problems.
Methods
Although HTTP was designed for use in the Web, it was intentionally made
more general than necessary with an eye to future object-oriented uses. For this
reason, operations, called methods, other than just requesting a Web page are
supported. This generality is what permitted SOAP to come into existence.
Each request consists of one or more lines of ASCII text, with the first word
on the first line being the name of the method requested. The built-in methods are
listed in Fig. 7-37. The names are case sensitive, so GET is allowed but not get.

of a file is sufficient to understand the concepts.) The page is suitably encoded in
MIME. The vast majority of requests to Web servers are GETs. The usual form
of GET is
GET filename HTTP/1.1
where filename names the page to be fetched and 1.1 is the protocol version.
The HEAD method just asks for the message header, without the actual page.
This method can be used to collect information for indexing purposes, or just to
test a URL for validity.
The POST method is used when forms are submitted. Both it and GET are
also used for SOAP Web services. Like GET, it bears a URL, but instead of sim-
ply retrieving a page it uploads data to the server (i.e., the contents of the form or
RPC parameters). The server then does something with the data that depends on
the URL, conceptually appending the data to the object. The effect might be to
purchase an item, for example, or to call a procedure. Finally, the method returns
a page indicating the result.
The remaining methods are not used much for browsing the Web. The PUT
method is the reverse of GET: instead of reading the page, it writes the page. This
method makes it possible to build a collection of Web pages on a remote server.
The body of the request contains the page. It may be encoded using MIME, in
which case the lines following the PUT might include authentication headers, to
prove that the caller indeed has permission to perform the requested operation.
DELETE does what you might expect: it removes the page, or at least it indi-
cates that the Web server has agreed to remove the page.
As with PUT,
authentication and permission play a major role here.
The TRACE method is for debugging. It instructs the server to send back the
request. This method is useful when requests are not being processed correctly
and the client wants to know what request the server actually got.
The CONNECT method lets a user make a connection to a Web server
through an intermediate device, such as a Web cache.
The OPTIONS method provides a way for the client to query the server for a
page and obtain the methods and headers that can be used with that page.
Every request gets a response consisting of a status line, and possibly addi-
tional information (e.g., all or part of a Web page). The status line contains a
three-digit status code telling whether the request was satisfied and, if not, why
not. The first digit is used to divide the responses into five major groups, as
shown in Fig. 7-38. The 1xx codes are rarely used in practice. The 2xx codes
mean that the request was handled successfully and the content (if any) is being
returned. The 3xx codes tell the client to look elsewhere, either using a different
URL or in its own cache (discussed later). The 4xx codes mean the request failed
due to a client error such an invalid request or a nonexistent page. Finally, the
5xx errors mean the server itself has an internal problem, either due to an error in
its code or to a temporary overload.

Message Headers
The request line (e.g., the line with the GET method) may be followed by ad-
ditional lines with more information. They are called request headers. This
information can be compared to the parameters of a procedure call. Responses
may also have response headers. Some headers can be used in either direction.
A selection of the more important ones is given in Fig. 7-39. This list is not short,
so as you might imagine there is often a variety of headers on each request and re-
sponse.
The User-Agent header allows the client to inform the server about its brow-
ser implementation (e.g., Mozilla/5.0 and Chrome/5.0.375.125). This information
is useful to let servers tailor their responses to the browser, since different brow-
sers can have widely varying capabilities and behaviors.
The four Accept headers tell the server what the client is willing to accept in
the event that it has a limited repertoire of what is acceptable. The first header
specifies the MIME types that are welcome (e.g., text/html). The second gives the
character set (e.g., ISO-8859-5 or Unicode-1-1). The third deals with compres-
sion methods (e.g., gzip). The fourth indicates a natural language (e.g., Spanish).
If the server has a choice of pages, it can use this information to supply the one
the client is looking for. If it is unable to satisfy the request, an error code is re-
turned and the request fails.
The If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match headers are used with caching.
They let the client ask for a page to be sent only if the cached copy is no longer
valid. We will describe caching shortly.
The Host header names the server. It is taken from the URL. This header is
mandatory. It is used because some IP addresses may serve multiple DNS names
and the server needs some way to tell which host to hand the request to.
The Authorization header is needed for pages that are protected. In this case,
the client may have to prove it has a right to see the page requested. This header
is used for that case.
The client uses the misspelled Referer header to give the URL that referred to
the URL that is now requested. Most often this is the URL of the previous page.

This header is particularly useful for tracking Web browsing, as it tells servers
how a client arrived at the page.
Although cookies are dealt with in RFC 2109 rather than RFC 2616, they also
have headers. The Set-Cookie header is how servers send cookies to clients. The
client is expected to save the cookie and return it on subsequent requests to the
server by using the Cookie header. (Note that there is a more recent specification
for cookies with newer headers, RFC 2965, but this has largely been rejected by
industry and is not widely implemented.)

Many other headers are used in responses. The Server header allows the ser-
ver to identify its software build if it wishes. The next five headers, all starting
with Content-, allow the server to describe properties of the page it is sending.
The Last-Modified header tells when the page was last modified, and the Ex-
pires header tells for how long the page will remain valid. Both of these headers
play an important role in page caching.
The Location header is used by the server to inform the client that it should
try a different URL. This can be used if the page has moved or to allow multiple
URLs to refer to the same page (possibly on different servers). It is also used for
companies that have a main Web page in the com domain but redirect clients to a
national or regional page based on their IP addresses or preferred language.
If a page is very large, a small client may not want it all at once. Some ser-
vers will accept requests for byte ranges, so the page can be fetched in multiple
small units. The Accept-Ranges header announces the server’s willingness to
handle this type of partial page request.
Now we come to headers that can be used in both directions. The Date head-
er can be used in both directions and contains the time and date the message was
sent, while the Range header tells the byte range of the page that is provided by
the response.
The ETag header gives a short tag that serves as a name for the content of the
page. It is used for caching. The Cache-Control header gives other explicit in-
structions about how to cache (or, more usually, how not to cache) pages.
Finally, the Upgrade header is used for switching to a new communication
protocol, such as a future HTTP protocol or a secure transport. It allows the client
to announce what it can support and the server to assert what it is using.
Caching
People often return to Web pages that they have viewed before, and related
Web pages often have the same embedded resources. Some examples are the
images that are used for navigation across the site, as well as common style sheets
and scripts. It would be very wasteful to fetch all of these resources for these
pages each time they are displayed because the browser already has a copy.
Squirreling away pages that are fetched for subsequent use is called caching.
The advantage is that when a cached page can be reused, it is not necessary to re-
peat the transfer. HTTP has built-in support to help clients identify when they can
safely reuse pages. This support improves performance by reducing both network
traffic and latency. The trade-off is that the browser must now store pages, but
this is nearly always a worthwhile trade-off because local storage is inexpensive.
The pages are usually kept on disk so that they can be used when the browser is
run at a later date.
The difficult issue with HTTP caching is how to determine that a previously
cached copy of a page is the same as the page would be if it was fetched again.

This determination cannot be made solely from the URL. For example, the URL
may give a page that displays the latest news item. The contents of this page will
be updated frequently even though the URL stays the same. Alternatively, the
contents of the page may be a list of the gods from Greek and Roman mythology.
This page should change somewhat less rapidly.
HTTP uses two strategies to tackle this problem. They are shown in Fig. 7-40
as forms of processing between the request (step 1) and the response (step 5). The
first strategy is page validation (step 2). The cache is consulted, and if it has a
copy of a page for the requested URL that is known to be fresh (i.e., still valid),
there is no need to fetch it anew from the server. Instead, the cached page can be
returned directly. The Expires header returned when the cached page was origi-
nally fetched and the current date and time can be used to make this determina-
tion.

Figure 7-40. HTTP caching.
However, not all pages come with a convenient Expires header that tells when
the page must be fetched again. After all, making predictions is hard—especially
about the future. In this case, the browser may use heuristics. For example, if the
page has not been modified in the past year (as told by the Last-Modified header)
it is a fairly safe bet that it will not change in the next hour. There is no guaran-
tee, however, and this may be a bad bet. For example, the stock market might
have closed for the day so that the page will not change for hours, but it will
change rapidly once the next trading session starts. Thus, the cacheability of a
page may vary wildly over time. For this reason, heuristics should be used with
care, though they often work well in practice.
Finding pages that have not expired is the most beneficial use of caching be-
cause it means that the server does not need to be contacted at all. Unfortunately,
it does not always work. Servers must use the Expires header conservatively,
since they may be unsure when a page will be updated. Thus, the cached copies
may still be fresh, but the client does not know.
The second strategy is used in this case. It is to ask the server if the cached
copy is still valid. This request is a conditional GET, and it is shown in Fig. 7-40
as step 3. If the server knows that the cached copy is still valid, it can send a short
reply to say so (step 4a). Otherwise, it must send the full response (step 4b).

THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
More header fields are used to let the server check whether a cached copy is
still valid. The client has the time a cached page was last updated from the Last-
Modified header. It can send this time to the server using the If-Modified-Since
header to ask for the page only if it has been changed in the meantime.
Alternatively, the server may return an ETag header with a page. This header
gives a tag that is a short name for the content of the page, like a checksum but
better. (It can be a cryptographic hash, which we will describe in Chap. 8.) The
client can validate cached copies by sending the server an If-None-Match header
listing the tags of the cached copies. If any of the tags match the content that the
server would respond with, the corresponding cached copy may be used. This
method can be used when it is not convenient or useful to determine freshness.
For example, a server may return different content for the same URL depending
on what languages and MIME types are preferred. In this case, the modification
date alone will not help the server to determine if the cached page is fresh.
Finally, note that both of these caching strategies are overridden by the direc-
tives carried in the Cache-Control header. These directives can be used to restrict
caching (e.g., no-cache) when it is not appropriate. An example is a dynamic
page that will be different the next time it is fetched. Pages that require authoriza-
tion are also not cached.
There is much more to caching, but we only have the space to make two im-
portant points. First, caching can be performed at other places besides in the
browser. In the general case, HTTP requests can be routed through a series of
caches. The use of a cache external to the browser is called proxy caching. Each
added level of caching can help to reduce requests further up the chain. It is com-
mon for organizations such as ISPs and companies to run proxy caches to gain the
benefits of caching pages across different users. We will discuss proxy caching
with the broader topic of content distribution in Sec. 7.5 at the end of this chapter.
Second, caches provide an important boost to performance, but not as much as
one might hope. The reason is that, while there are certainly popular documents
on the Web, there are also a great many unpopular documents that people fetch,
many of which are also very long (e.g., videos). The ‘‘long tail’’ of unpopular doc-
uments take up space in caches, and the number of requests that can be handled
from the cache grows only slowly with the size of the cache. Web caches are al-
ways likely to be able to handle less than half of the requests. See Breslau et al.
(1999) for more information.
Experimenting with HTTP
Because HTTP is an ASCII protocol, it is quite easy for a person at a terminal
(as opposed to a browser) to directly talk to Web servers. All that is needed is a
TCP connection to port 80 on the server. Readers are encouraged to experiment
with the following command sequence. It will work in most UNIX shells and the
command window on Windows (once the telnet program is enabled).

next line is the mandatory Host header. A blank line following the last header is
mandatory. It tells the server that there are no more request headers. The server
will then send the response. Depending on the server and the URL, many different
kinds of headers and pages can be observed.
7.3.5 The Mobile Web
The Web is used from most every type of computer, and that includes mobile
phones. Browsing the Web over a wireless network while mobile can be very use-
ful. It also presents technical problems because much Web content was designed
for flashy presentations on desktop computers with broadband connectivity. In
this section we will describe how Web access from mobile devices, or the mobile
Web, is being developed.
Compared to desktop computers at work or at home, mobile phones present
several difficulties for Web browsing:
1. Relatively small screens preclude large pages and large images.
2. Limited input capabilities make it tedious to enter URLs or other
lengthy input.
3. Network bandwidth is limited over wireless links, particularly on cel-
lular (3G) networks, where it is often expensive too.
4. Connectivity may be intermittent.
5. Computing power is limited, for reasons of battery life, size, heat
dissipation, and cost.
These difficulties mean that simply using desktop content for the mobile Web is
likely to deliver a frustrating user experience.
Early approaches to the mobile Web devised a new protocol stack tailored to
wireless devices with limited capabilities. WAP (Wireless Application Proto-
col) is the most well-known example of this strategy. The WAP effort was started
in 1997 by major mobile phone vendors that included Nokia, Ericsson, and
Motorola. However, something unexpected happened along the way. Over the
next decade, network bandwidth and device capabilities grew tremendously with
the deployment of 3G data services and mobile phones with larger color displays,

faster processors, and 802.11 wireless capabilities. All of a sudden, it was pos-
sible for mobiles to run simple Web browsers. There is still a gap between these
mobiles and desktops that will never close, but many of the technology problems
that gave impetus to a separate protocol stack have faded.
The approach that is increasingly used is to run the same Web protocols for
mobiles and desktops, and to have Web sites deliver mobile-friendly content when
the user happens to be on a mobile device. Web servers are able to detect whether
to return desktop or mobile versions of Web pages by looking at the request head-
ers. The User-Agent header is especially useful in this regard because it identifies
the browser software. Thus, when a Web server receives a request, it may look at
the headers and return a page with small images, less text, and simpler navigation
to an iPhone and a full-featured page to a user on a laptop.
W3C is encouraging this approach in several ways. One way is to standardize
best practices for mobile Web content. A list of 60 such best practices is provided
in the first specification (Rabin and McCathieNevile, 2008). Most of these prac-
tices take sensible steps to reduce the size of pages, including by the use of com-
pression, since the costs of communication are higher than those of computation,
and by maximizing the effectiveness of caching. This approach encourages sites,
especially large sites, to create mobile Web versions of their content because that
is all that is required to capture mobile Web users. To help those users along,
there is also a logo to indicate pages that can be viewed (well) on the mobile Web.
Another useful tool is a stripped-down version of HTML called XHTML
Basic. This language is a subset of XHTML that is intended for use by mobile
phones, televisions, PDAs, vending machines, pagers, cars, game machines, and
even watches. For this reason, it does not support style sheets, scripts, or frames,
but most of the standard tags are there. They are grouped into 11 modules. Some
are required; some are optional. All are defined in XML. The modules and some
example tags are listed in Fig. 7-41.
However, not all pages will be designed to work well on the mobile Web.
Thus, a complementary approach is the use of content transformation or trans-
coding. In this approach, a computer that sits between the mobile and the server
takes requests from the mobile, fetches content from the server, and transforms it
to mobile Web content. A simple transformation is to reduce the size of large
images by reformatting them at a lower resolution. Many other small but useful
transformations are possible. Transcoding has been used with some success since
the early days of the mobile Web. See, for example, Fox et al. (1996). However,
when both approaches are used there is a tension between the mobile content de-
cisions that are made by the server and by the transcoder. For instance, a Web site
may select a particular combination of image and text for a mobile Web user, only
to have a transcoder change the format of the image.
Our discussion so far has been about content, not protocols, as it is the content
that is the biggest problem in realizing the mobile Web. However, we will briefly
mention the issue of protocols. The HTTP, TCP, and IP protocols used by the

Web may consume a significant amount of bandwidth on protocol overheads such
as headers. To tackle this problem, WAP and other solutions defined special-pur-
pose protocols. This turns out to be largely unecessary. Header compression tech-
nologies, such as ROHC (RObust Header Compression) described in Chap. 6, can
reduce the overheads of these protocols. In this way, it is possible to have one set
of protocols (HTTP, TCP, IP) and use them over either high- or low- bandwidth
links. Use over the low-bandwidth links simply requires that header compression
be turned on.
7.3.6 Web Search
To finish our description of the Web, we will discuss what is arguably the
most successful Web application: search. In 1998, Sergey Brin and Larry Page,
then graduate students at Stanford, formed a startup called Google to build a bet-
ter Web search engine. They were armed with the then-radical idea that a search
algorithm that counted how many times each page was pointed to by other pages
was a better measure of its importance than how many times it contained the key
words being sought. For instance, many pages link to the main Cisco page, which
makes this page more important to a user searching for ‘‘Cisco’’ than a page out-
side of the company that happens to use the word ‘‘Cisco’’ many times.
They were right. It did prove possible to build a better search engine, and
people flocked to it. Backed by venture capital, Google grew tremendously. It
became a public company in 2004, with a market capitalization of $23 billion. By
2010, it was estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers
throughout the world.

CHAP. 7
In one sense, search is simply another Web application, albeit one of the most
mature Web applications because it has been under development since the early
days of the Web. However, Web search has proved indispensible in everyday
usage. Over one billion Web searches are estimated to be done each day. People
looking for all manner of information use search as a starting point. For example,
to find out where to buy Vegemite in Seattle, there is no obvious Web site to use
as a starting point. But chances are that a search engine knows of a page with the
desired information and can quickly direct you to the answer.
To perform a Web search in the traditional manner, the user directs her brow-
ser to the URL of a Web search site. The major search sites include Google,
Yahoo!, and Bing. Next, the user submits search terms using a form. This act
causes the search engine to perform a query on its database for relevant pages or
images, or whatever kind of resource is being searched for, and return the result as
a dynamic page. The user can then follow links to the pages that have been found.
Web search is an interesting topic for discussion because it has implications
for the design and use of networks. First, there is the question of how Web search
finds pages. The Web search engine must have a database of pages to run a
query. Each HTML page may contain links to other pages, and everything inter-
esting (or at least searchable) is linked somewhere. This means that it is theoreti-
cally possible to start with a handful of pages and find all other pages on the Web
by doing a traversal of all pages and links. This process is called Web crawling.
All Web search engines use Web crawlers.
One issue with crawling is the kind of pages that it can find. Fetching static
documents and following links is easy. However, many Web pages contain pro-
grams that display different pages depending on user interaction. An example is
an online catalog for a store. The catalog may contain dynamic pages created
from a product database and queries for different products. This kind of content is
different from static pages that are easy to traverse. How do Web crawlers find
these dynamic pages? The answer is that, for the most part, they do not. This kind
of hidden content is called the deep Web. How to search the deep Web is an
open problem that researchers are now tackling. See, for example, madhavan et al.
(2008). There are also conventions by which sites make a page (known as
robots.txt) to tell crawlers what parts of the sites should or should not be visited.
A second consideration is how to process all of the crawled data. To let
indexing algorithms be run over the mass of data, the pages must be stored. Esti-
mates vary, but the main search engines are thought to have an index of tens of
billions of pages taken from the visible part of the Web. The average page size is
estimated at 320 KB. These figures mean that a crawled copy of the Web takes
on the order of 20 petabytes or 2 × 1016 bytes to store. While this is a truly huge
number, it is also an amount of data that can comfortably be stored and processed
in Internet data centers (Chang et al., 2006). For example, if disk storage costs
$20/TB, then 2 × 104 TB costs $400,000, which is not exactly a huge amount for
companies the size of Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!. And while the Web is

expanding, disk costs are dropping dramatically, so storing the entire Web may
continue to be feasible for large companies for the foreseeable future.
Making sense of this data is another matter. You can appreciate how XML
can help programs extract the structure of the data easily, while ad hoc formats
will lead to much guesswork. There is also the issue of conversion between for-
mats, and even translation between languages. But even knowing the structure of
data is only part of the problem. The hard bit is to understand what it means. This
is where much value can be unlocked, starting with more relevant result pages for
search queries. The ultimate goal is to be able to answer questions, for example,
where to buy a cheap but decent toaster oven in your city.
A third aspect of Web search is that it has come to provide a higher level of
naming. There is no need to remember a long URL if it is just as reliable (or per-
haps more) to search for a Web page by a person’s name, assuming that you are
better at remembering names than URLs. This strategy is increasingly successful.
In the same way that DNS names relegated IP addresses to computers, Web
search is relegating URLs to computers. Also in favor of search is that it corrects
spelling and typing errors, whereas if you type in a URL wrong, you get the
wrong page.
Finally, Web search shows us something that has little to do with network de-
sign but much to do with the growth of some Internet services: there is much
money in advertising. Advertising is the economic engine that has driven the
growth of Web search. The main change from print advertising is the ability to
target advertisements depending on what people are searching for, to increase the
relevance of the advertisements. Variations on an auction mechanism are used to
match the search query to the most valuable advertisement (Edelman et al., 2007).
This new model has given rise to new problems, of course, such as click fraud, in
which programs imitate users and click on advertisements to cause payments that
have not been fairly earned.
7.4 STREAMING AUDIO AND VIDEO
Web applications and the mobile Web are not the only exciting developments
in the use of networks. For many people, audio and video are the holy grail of net-
working. When the word ‘‘multimedia’’ is mentioned, both the propellerheads
and the suits begin salivating as if on cue. The former see immense technical
challenges in providing voice over IP and video-on-demand to every computer.
The latter see equally immense profits in it.
While the idea of sending audio and video over the Internet has been around
since the 1970s at least, it is only since roughly 2000 that real-time audio and
real-time video traffic has grown with a vengeance. Real-time traffic is different
from Web traffic in that it must be played out at some predetermined rate to be
useful. After all, watching a video in slow motion with fits and starts is not most

people’s idea of fun. In contrast, the Web can have short interruptions, and page
loads can take more or less time, within limits, without it being a major problem.
Two things happened to enable this growth. First, computers have became
much more powerful and are equipped with microphones and cameras so that they
can input, process, and output audio and video data with ease. Second, a flood of
Internet bandwidth has come to be available. Long-haul links in the core of the In-
ternet run at many gigabits/sec, and broadband and 802.11 wireless reaches users
at the edge of the Internet. These developments allow ISPs to carry tremendous
levels of traffic across their backbones and mean that ordinary users can connect
to the Internet 100–1000 times faster than with a 56-kbps telephone modem.
The flood of bandwidth caused audio and video traffic to grow, but for dif-
ferent reasons. Telephone calls take up relatively little bandwidth (in principle 64
kbps but less when compressed) yet telephone service has traditionally been ex-
pensive. Companies saw an opportunity to carry voice traffic over the Internet
using existing bandwidth to cut down on their telephone bills. Startups such as
Skype saw a way to let customers make free telephone calls using their Internet
connections. Upstart telephone companies saw a cheap way to carry traditional
voice calls using IP networking equipment. The result was an explosion of voice
data carried over Internet networks that is called voice over IP or Internet
telephony.
Unlike audio, video takes up a large amount of bandwidth. Reasonable quali-
ty Internet video is encoded with compression at rates of around 1 Mbps, and a
typical DVD movie is 2 GB of data. Before broadband Internet access, sending
movies over the network was prohibitive. Not so any more. With the spread of
broadband, it became possible for the first time for users to watch decent, stream-
ed video at home. People love to do it. Around a quarter of the Internet users on
any given day are estimated to visit YouTube, the popular video sharing site. The
movie rental business has shifted to online downloads. And the sheer size of
videos has changed the overall makeup of Internet traffic. The majority of Inter-
net traffic is already video, and it is estimated that 90% of Internet traffic will be
video within a few years (Cisco, 2010).
Given that there is enough bandwidth to carry audio and video, the key issue
for designing streaming and conferencing applications is network delay. Audio
and video need real-time presentation, meaning that they must be played out at a
predetermined rate to be useful. Long delays mean that calls that should be
interactive no longer are. This problem is clear if you have ever talked on a satel-
lite phone, where the delay of up to half a second is quite distracting. For playing
music and movies over the network, the absolute delay does not matter, because it
only affects when the media starts to play. But the variation in delay, called
jitter, still matters. It must be masked by the player or the audio will sound unin-
telligible and the video will look jerky.
In this section, we will discuss some strategies to handle the delay problem, as
well as protocols for setting up audio and video sessions. After an introduction to

digital audio and video, our presentation is broken into three cases for which dif-
ferent designs are used. The first and easiest case to handle is streaming stored
media, like watching a video on YouTube. The next case in terms of difficulty is
streaming live media. Two examples are Internet radio and IPTV, in which radio
and television stations broadcast to many users live on the Internet. The last and
most difficult case is a call as might be made with Skype, or more generally an
interactive audio and video conference.
As an aside, the term multimedia is often used in the context of the Internet
to mean video and audio. Literally, multimedia is just two or more media. That
definition makes this book a multimedia presentation, as it contains text and
graphics (the figures). However, that is probably not what you had in mind, so we
use the term ‘‘multimedia’’ to imply two or more continuous media, that is,
media that have to be played during some well-defined time interval. The two
media are normally video with audio, that is, moving pictures with sound. Many
people also refer to pure audio, such as Internet telephony or Internet radio, as
multimedia as well, which it is clearly not. Actually, a better term for all these
cases is streaming media. Nonetheless, we will follow the herd and consider
real-time audio to be multimedia as well.
7.4.1 Digital Audio
An audio (sound) wave is a one-dimensional acoustic (pressure) wave. When
an acoustic wave enters the ear, the eardrum vibrates, causing the tiny bones of
the inner ear to vibrate along with it, sending nerve pulses to the brain. These
pulses are perceived as sound by the listener. In a similar way, when an acoustic
wave strikes a microphone, the microphone generates an electrical signal, repres-
enting the sound amplitude as a function of time.
The frequency range of the human ear runs from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Some
animals, notably dogs, can hear higher frequencies. The ear hears loudness loga-
rithmically, so the ratio of two sounds with power A and B is conventionally
expressed in dB (decibels) as the quantity 10 log10(A /B). If we define the lower
limit of audibility (a sound pressure of about 20 μPascals) for a 1-kHz sine wave
as 0 dB, an ordinary conversation is about 50 dB and the pain threshold is about
120 dB. The dynamic range is a factor of more than 1 million.
The ear is surprisingly sensitive to sound variations lasting only a few
milliseconds. The eye, in contrast, does not notice changes in light level that last
only a few milliseconds. The result of this observation is that jitter of only a few
milliseconds during the playout of multimedia affects the perceived sound quality
much more than it affects the perceived image quality.
Digital audio is a digital representation of an audio wave that can be used to
recreate it. Audio waves can be converted to digital form by an ADC (Analog-
to-Digital Converter). An ADC takes an electrical voltage as input and gener-
ates a binary number as output. In Fig. 7-42(a) we see an example of a sine wave.

To represent this signal digitally, we can sample it every ΔT seconds, as shown by
the bar heights in Fig. 7-42(b). If a sound wave is not a pure sine wave but a
linear superposition of sine waves where the highest frequency component present
is f, the Nyquist theorem (see Chap. 2) states that it is sufficient to make samples
at a frequency 2f. Sampling more often is of no value since the higher frequencies
that such sampling could detect are not present.

samples to 4 bits.
The reverse process takes digital values and produces an analog electrical
voltage. It is done by a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). A loudspeaker can
then convert the analog voltage to acoustic waves so that people can hear sounds.
Digital samples are never exact. The samples of Fig. 7-42(c) allow only nine
values, from −1.00 to +1.00 in steps of 0.25. An 8-bit sample would allow 256
distinct values. A 16-bit sample would allow 65,536 distinct values. The error in-
troduced by the finite number of bits per sample is called the quantization noise.
If it is too large, the ear detects it.
Two well-known examples where sampled sound is used are the telephone
and audio compact discs. Pulse code modulation, as used within the telephone
system, uses 8-bit samples made 8000 times per second. The scale is nonlinear to
minimize perceived distortion, and with only 8000 samples/sec, frequencies above
4 kHz are lost. In North America and Japan, the μ-law encoding is used. In
Europe and internationally, the A-law encoding is used. Each encoding gives a
data rate of 64,000 bps.
Audio CDs are digital with a sampling rate of 44,100 samples/sec, enough to
capture frequencies up to 22,050 Hz, which is good enough for people but bad for
canine music lovers. The samples are 16 bits each and are linear over the range of
amplitudes. Note that 16-bit samples allow only 65,536 distinct values, even
though the dynamic range of the ear is more than 1 million. Thus, even though
CD-quality audio is much better than telephone-quality audio, using only 16 bits
per sample introduces noticeable quantization noise (although the full dynamic
range is not covered—CDs are not supposed to hurt). Some fanatic audiophiles

still prefer 33-RPM LP records to CDs because records do not have a Nyquist fre-
quency cutoff at 22 kHz and have no quantization noise. (But they do have
scratches unless handled very carefully) With 44,100 samples/sec of 16 bits each,
uncompressed CD-quality audio needs a bandwidth of 705.6 kbps for monaural
and 1.411 Mbps for stereo.
Audio Compression
Audio is often compressed to reduce bandwidth needs and transfer times, even
though audio data rates are much lower than video data rates. All compression
systems require two algorithms: one for compressing the data at the source, and
another for decompressing it at the destination. In the literature, these algorithms
are referred to as the encoding and decoding algorithms, respectively. We will
use this terminology too.
Compression algorithms exhibit certain asymmetries that are important to un-
derstand. Even though we are considering audio first, these asymmetries hold for
video as well. For many applications, a multimedia document will only be en-
coded once (when it is stored on the multimedia server) but will be decoded thou-
sands of times (when it is played back by customers). This asymmetry means that
it is acceptable for the encoding algorithm to be slow and require expensive hard-
ware provided that the decoding algorithm is fast and does not require expensive
hardware. The operator of a popular audio (or video) server might be quite wil-
ling to buy a cluster of computers to encode its entire library, but requiring cus-
tomers to do the same to listen to music or watch movies is not likely to be a big
success. Many practical compression systems go to great lengths to make decod-
ing fast and simple, even at the price of making encoding slow and complicated.
On the other hand, for live audio and video, such as a voice-over-IP calls,
slow encoding is unacceptable. Encoding must happen on the fly, in real time.
Consequently, real-time multimedia uses different algorithms or parameters than
stored audio or videos on disk, often with appreciably less compression.
A second asymmetry is that the encode/decode process need not be invertible.
That is, when compressing a data file, transmitting it, and then decompressing it,
the user expects to get the original back, accurate down to the last bit. With mul-
timedia, this requirement does not exist. It is usually acceptable to have the audio
(or video) signal after encoding and then decoding be slightly different from the
original as long as it sounds (or looks) the same. When the decoded output is not
exactly equal to the original input, the system is said to be lossy. If the input and
output are identical, the system is lossless. Lossy systems are important because
accepting a small amount of information loss normally means a huge payoff in
terms of the compression ratio possible.
Historically, long-haul bandwidth in the telephone network was very expen-
sive, so there is a substantial body of work on vocoders (short for ‘‘voice coders’’)
that compress audio for the special case of speech. Human speech tends to be in

the 600-Hz to 6000-Hz range and is produced by a mechanical process that de-
pends on the speaker’s vocal tract, tongue, and jaw. Some vocoders make use of
models of the vocal system to reduce speech to a few parameters (e.g., the sizes
and shapes of various cavities) and a data rate of as little as 2.4 kbps. How these
vocoders work is beyond the scope of this book, however.
We will concentrate on audio as sent over the Internet, which is typically
closer to CD-quality. It is also desirable to reduce the data rates for this kind of
audio. At 1.411 Mbps, stereo audio would tie up many broadband links, leaving
less room for video and other Web traffic. Its data rate with compression can be
reduced by an order of magnitude with little to no perceived loss of quality.
Compression and decompression require signal processing. Fortunately, digi-
tized sound and movies can be easily processed by computers in software. In fact,
dozens of programs exist to let users record, display, edit, mix, and store media
from multiple sources. This has led to large amounts of music and movies being
available on the Internet—not all of it legal—which has resulted in numerous law-
suits from the artists and copyright owners.
Many audio compression algorithms have been developed. Probably the most
popular formats are MP3 (MPEG audio layer 3) and AAC (Advanced Audio
Coding) as carried in MP4 (MPEG-4) files.
To avoid confusion, note that
MPEG provides audio and video compression. MP3 refers to the audio compres-
sion portion (part 3) of the MPEG-1 standard, not the third version of MPEG. In
fact, no third version of MPEG was released, only MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and
MPEG-4. AAC is the successor to MP3 and the default audio encoding used in
MPEG-4. MPEG-2 allows both MP3 and AAC audio. Is that clear now? The nice
thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from. And if you do not
like any of them, just wait a year or two.
Audio compression can be done in two ways. In waveform coding, the sig-
nal is transformed mathematically by a Fourier transform into its frequency com-
ponents. In Chap. 2, we showed an example function of time and its Fourier am-
plitudes in Fig. 2-1(a). The amplitude of each component is then encoded in a
minimal way. The goal is to reproduce the waveform fairly accurately at the
other end in as few bits as possible.
The other way, perceptual coding, exploits certain flaws in the human audi-
tory system to encode a signal in such a way that it sounds the same to a human
listener, even if it looks quite different on an oscilloscope. Perceptual coding is
based on the science of psychoacoustics—how people perceive sound. Both
MP3 and AAC are based on perceptual coding.
The key property of perceptual coding is that some sounds can mask other
sounds. Imagine you are broadcasting a live flute concert on a warm summer day.
Then all of a sudden, out of the blue, a crew of workmen nearby turn on their
jackhammers and start tearing up the street. No one can hear the flute any more.
Its sounds have been masked by the jackhammers. For transmission purposes, it
is now sufficient to encode just the frequency band used by the jackhammers

703
because the listeners cannot hear the flute anyway. This is called frequency
masking—the ability of a loud sound in one frequency band to hide a softer sound
in another frequency band that would have been audible in the absence of the loud
sound. In fact, even after the jackhammers stop, the flute will be inaudible for a
short period of time because the ear turns down its gain when they start and it
takes a finite time to turn it up again. This effect is called temporal masking.
To make these effects more quantitative, imagine experiment 1. A person in a
quiet room puts on headphones connected to a computer’s sound card. The com-
puter generates a pure sine wave at 100 Hz at low, but gradually increasing, pow-
er. The subject is instructed to strike a key when she hears the tone. The com-
puter records the current power level and then repeats the experiment at 200 Hz,
300 Hz, and all the other frequencies up to the limit of human hearing. When
averaged over many people, a log-log graph of how much power it takes for a
tone to be audible looks like that of Fig. 7-43(a). A direct consequence of this
curve is that it is never necessary to encode any frequencies whose power falls
below the threshold of audibility. For example, if the power at 100 Hz were 20
dB in Fig. 7-43(a), it could be omitted from the output with no perceptible loss of
quality because 20 dB at 100 Hz falls below the level of audibility.

Now consider experiment 2. The computer runs experiment 1 again, but this
time with a constant-amplitude sine wave at, say, 150 Hz superimposed on the test
frequency. What we discover is that the threshold of audibility for frequencies
near 150 Hz is raised, as shown in Fig. 7-43(b).
The consequence of this new observation is that by keeping track of which
signals are being masked by more powerful signals in nearby frequency bands, we
can omit more and more frequencies in the encoded signal, saving bits. In Fig. 7-
43, the 125-Hz signal can be completely omitted from the output and no one will
be able to hear the difference. Even after a powerful signal stops in some fre-
quency band, knowledge of its temporal masking properties allows us to continue
to omit the masked frequencies for some time interval as the ear recovers. The

essence of MP3 and AAC is to Fourier-transform the sound to get the power at
each frequency and then transmit only the unmasked frequencies, encoding these
in as few bits as possible.
With this information as background, we can now see how the encoding is
done. The audio compression is done by sampling the waveform at a rate from 8
to 96 kHz for AAC, often at 44.1 kHz, to mimic CD sound. Sampling can be
done on one (mono) or two (stereo) channels. Next, the output bit rate is chosen.
MP3 can compress a stereo rock ’n roll CD down to 96 kbps with little perceptible
loss in quality, even for rock ’n roll fans with no hearing loss. For a piano con-
cert, AAC with at least 128 kbps is needed. The difference is because the signal-
to-noise ratio for rock ’n roll is much higher than for a piano concert (in an engin-
eering sense, anyway). It is also possible to choose lower output rates and accept
some loss in quality.
The samples are processed in small batches. Each batch is passed through a
bank of digital filters to get frequency bands. The frequency information is fed
into a psychoacoustic model to determine the masked frequencies.
Then the
available bit budget is divided among the bands, with more bits allocated to the
bands with the most unmasked spectral power, fewer bits allocated to unmasked
bands with less spectral power, and no bits allocated to masked bands. Finally,
the bits are encoded using Huffman encoding, which assigns short codes to num-
bers that appear frequently and long codes to those that occur infrequently. There
are many more details for the curious reader. For more information, see Branden-
burg (1999).
7.4.2 Digital Video
Now that we know all about the ear, it is time to move on to the eye. (No, this
section is not followed by one on the nose.) The human eye has the property that
when an image appears on the retina, the image is retained for some number of
milliseconds before decaying. If a sequence of images is drawn at 50 images/sec,
the eye does not notice that it is looking at discrete images. All video systems
exploit this principle to produce moving pictures.
The simplest digital representation of video is a sequence of frames, each con-
sisting of a rectangular grid of picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel can be a
single bit, to represent either black or white. However, the quality of such a sys-
tem is awful. Try using your favorite image editor to convert the pixels of a color
image to black and white (and not shades of gray).
The next step up is to use 8 bits per pixel to represent 256 gray levels. This
scheme gives high-quality ‘‘black-and-white’’ video. For color video, many sys-
tems use 8 bits for each of the red, green and blue (RGB) primary color compo-
nents. This representation is possible because any color can be constructed from a
linear superposition of red, green, and blue with the appropriate intensities. With

24 bits per pixel, there are about 16 million colors, which is more than the human
eye can distinguish.
On color LCD computer monitors and televisions, each discrete pixel is made
up of closely spaced red, green and blue subpixels. Frames are displayed by set-
ting the intensity of the subpixels, and the eye blends the color components.
Common frame rates are 24 frames/sec (inherited from 35mm motion-picture
film), 30 frames/sec (inherited from NTSC U.S. televisions), and 30 frames/sec
(inherited from the PAL television system used in nearly all the rest of the world).
(For the truly picky, NTSC color television runs at 29.97 frames/sec. The original
black-and-white system ran at 30 frames/sec, but when color was introduced, the
engineers needed a bit of extra bandwidth for signaling so they reduced the frame
rate to 29.97. NTSC videos intended for computers really use 30.) PAL was in-
vented after NTSC and really uses 25.000 frames/sec. To make this story com-
plete, a third system, SECAM, is used in France, Francophone Africa, and Eastern
Europe. It was first introduced into Eastern Europe by then Communist East Ger-
many so the East German people could not watch West German (PAL) television
lest they get Bad Ideas. But many of these countries are switching to PAL. Tech-
nology and politics at their best.
Actually, for broadcast television, 25 frames/sec is not quite good enough for
smooth motion so the images are split into two fields, one with the odd-numbered
scan lines and one with the even-numbered scan lines. The two (half-resolution)
fields are broadcast sequentially, giving almost 60 (NTSC) or exactly 50 (PAL)
fields/sec, a system known as interlacing. Videos intended for viewing on a
computer are progressive, that is, do not use interlacing because computer moni-
tors have buffers on their graphics cards, making it possible for the CPU to put a
new image in the buffer 30 times/sec but have the graphics card redraw the screen
50 or even 100 times/sec to eliminate flicker. Analog television sets do not have a
frame buffer the way computers do. When an interlaced video with rapid move-
ment is displayed on a computer, short horizontal lines will be visible near sharp
edges, an effect known as combing.
The frame sizes used for video sent over the Internet vary widely for the sim-
ple reason that larger frames require more bandwidth, which may not always be
available. Low-resolution video might be 320 by 240 pixels, and ‘‘full-screen’’
video is 640 by 480 pixels. These dimensions approximate those of early com-
puter monitors and NTSC television, respectively. The aspect ratio, or width to
height ratio, of 4:3, is the same as a standard television. HDTV (High-Definition
TeleVision) videos can be downloaded with 1280 by 720 pixels. These
‘‘widescreen’’ images have an aspect ratio of 16:9 to more closely match the 3:2
aspect ratio of film. For comparison, standard DVD video is usually 720 by 480
pixels, and video on Blu-ray discs is usually HDTV at 1080 by 720 pixels.
On the Internet, the number of pixels is only part of the story, as media play-
ers can present the same image at different sizes. Video is just another window
on a computer screen that can be blown up or shrunk down. The role of more

pixels is to increase the quality of the image, so that it does not look blurry when
it is expanded. However, many monitors can show images (and hence videos)
with even more pixels than even HDTV.
Video Compression
It should be obvious from our discussion of digital video that compression is
critical for sending video over the Internet. Even a standard-quality video with
640 by 480 pixel frames, 24 bits of color information per pixel, and 30 frames/sec
takes over 200 Mbps. This far exceeds the bandwidth by which most company of-
fices are connected to the Internet, let alone home users, and this is for a single
video stream. Since transmitting uncompressed video is completely out of the
question, at least over wide area networks, the only hope is that massive compres-
sion is possible. Fortunately, a large body of research over the past few decades
has led to many compression techniques and algorithms that make video transmis-
sion feasible.
Many formats are used for video that is sent over the Internet, some propri-
etary and some standard. The most popular encoding is MPEG in its various
forms. It is an open standard found in files with mpg and mp4 extensions, as well
as in other container formats. In this section, we will look at MPEG to study how
video compression is accomplished. To begin, we will look at the compression of
still images with JPEG. A video is just a sequence of images (plus sound). One
way to compress video is to encode each image in succession. To a first approxi-
mation, MPEG is just the JPEG encoding of each frame, plus some extra features
for removing the redundancy across frames.
The JPEG Standard
The JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) standard for compressing
continuous-tone still pictures (e.g., photographs) was developed by photographic
experts working under the joint auspices of ITU, ISO, and IEC, another standards
body. It is widely used (look for files with the extension jpg) and often provides
compression ratios of 10:1 or better for natural images.
JPEG is defined in International Standard 10918. Really, it is more like a
shopping list than a single algorithm, but of the four modes that are defined only
the lossy sequential mode is relevant to our discussion. Furthermore, we will con-
centrate on the way JPEG is normally used to encode 24-bit RGB video images
and will leave out some of the options and details for the sake of simplicity.
The algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 7-44. Step 1 is block preparation. For the
sake of specificity, let us assume that the JPEG input is a 640 × 480 RGB image
with 24 bits/pixel, as shown in Fig. 7-44(a). RGB is not the best color model to
use for compression. The eye is much more sensitive to the luminance, or bright-
ness, of video signals than the chrominance, or color, of video signals. Thus, we

first compute the luminance, Y, and the two chrominances, Cb and Cr, from the R,
G, and B components. The following formulas are used for 8-bit values that range
from 0 to 255:
Y = 16 + 0.26R + 0.50G + 0.09B
Cb = 128 + 0.15R −0.29G −0.44B

Figure 7-44. Steps in JPEG lossy sequential encoding.
Separate matrices are constructed for Y, Cb, and Cr. Next, square blocks of
four pixels are averaged in the Cb and Cr matrices to reduce them to 320 × 240.
This reduction is lossy, but the eye barely notices it since the eye responds to
luminance more than to chrominance.
Nevertheless, it compresses the total
amount of data by a factor of two. Now 128 is subtracted from each element of
all three matrices to put 0 in the middle of the range. Finally, each matrix is
divided up into 8 × 8 blocks. The Y matrix has 4800 blocks; the other two have
1200 blocks each, as shown in Fig. 7-45(b).

Step 2 of JPEG encoding is to apply a DCT (Discrete Cosine Transforma-
tion) to each of the 7200 blocks separately. The output of each DCT is an 8 × 8
matrix of DCT coefficients. DCT element (0, 0) is the average value of the block.
The other elements tell how much spectral power is present at each spatial fre-
quency. Normally, these elements decay rapidly with distance from the origin, (0,
0), as suggested by Fig. 7-46.
Once the DCT is complete, JPEG encoding moves on to step 3, called quanti-
zation, in which the less important DCT coefficients are wiped out. This (lossy)

transformation is done by dividing each of the coefficients in the 8 × 8 DCT
matrix by a weight taken from a table. If all the weights are 1, the transformation
does nothing. However, if the weights increase sharply from the origin, higher
spatial frequencies are dropped quickly.
An example of this step is given in Fig. 7-47. Here we see the initial DCT
matrix, the quantization table, and the result obtained by dividing each DCT ele-
ment by the corresponding quantization table element. The values in the quanti-
zation table are not part of the JPEG standard. Each application must supply its
own, allowing it to control the loss-compression trade-off.

Step 4 reduces the (0, 0) value of each block (the one in the upper-left corner)
by replacing it with the amount it differs from the corresponding element in the
previous block. Since these elements are the averages of their respective blocks,
they should change slowly, so taking the differential values should reduce most of
them to small values. No differentials are computed from the other values.

Step 5 linearizes the 64 elements and applies run-length encoding to the list.
Scanning the block from left to right and then top to bottom will not concentrate
the zeros together, so a zigzag scanning pattern is used, as shown in Fig. 7-48. In
this example, the zigzag pattern produces 38 consecutive 0s at the end of the ma-
trix. This string can be reduced to a single count saying there are 38 zeros, a tech-
nique known as run-length encoding.

Figure 7-48. The order in which the quantized values are transmitted.
Now we have a list of numbers that represent the image (in transform space).
Step 6 Huffman-encodes the numbers for storage or transmission, assigning com-
mon numbers shorter codes than uncommon ones.
JPEG may seem complicated, but that is because it is complicated. Still, the
benefits of up to 20:1 compression are worth it. Decoding a JPEG image requires
running the algorithm backward. JPEG is roughly symmetric: decoding takes as
long as encoding. This property is not true of all compression algorithms, as we
shall now see.
The MPEG Standard
Finally, we come to the heart of the matter: the MPEG (Motion Picture
Experts Group) standards. Though there are many proprietary algorithms, these
standards define the main algorithms used to compress videos. They have been
international standards since 1993. Because movies contain both images and
sound, MPEG can compress both audio and video. We have already examined
audio compression and still image compression, so let us now examine video
compression.
The MPEG-1 standard (which includes MP3 audio) was first published in
1993 and is still widely used. Its goal was to produce video-recorder-quality out-
put that was compressed 40:1 to rates of around 1 Mbps. This video is suitable for

broad Internet use on Web sites. Do not worry if you do not remember video
recorders—MPEG-1 was also used for storing movies on CDs when they existed.
If you do not know what CDs are, we will have to move on to MPEG-2.
The MPEG-2 standard, released in 1996, was designed for compressing
broadcast-quality video. It is very common now, as it is used as the basis for video
encoded on DVDs (which inevitably finds its way onto the Internet) and for digi-
tal broadcast television (as DVB). DVD quality video is typically encoded at rates
of 4–8 Mbps.
The MPEG-4 standard has two video formats. The first format, released in
1999, encodes video with an object-based representation. This allows for the mix-
ing of natural and synthetic images and other kinds of media, for example, a
weatherperson standing in front of a weather map. With this structure, it is easy to
let programs interact with movie data. The second format, released in 2003, is
known as H.264 or AVC (Advanced Video Coding). Its goal is to encode video
at half the rate of earlier encoders for the same quality level, all the better to sup-
port the transmission of video over networks. This encoder is used for HDTV on
most Blu-ray discs.
The details of all these standards are many and varied. The later standards
also have many more features and encoding options than the earlier standards.
However, we will not go into the details. For the most part, the gains in video
compression over time have come from numerous small improvements, rather
than fundamental shifts in how video is compressed. Thus, we will sketch the
overall concepts.
MPEG compresses both audio and video. Since the audio and video encoders
work independently, there is an issue of how the two streams get synchronized at
the receiver. The solution is to have a single clock that outputs timestamps of the
current time to both encoders. These timestamps are included in the encoded out-
put and propagated all the way to the receiver, which can use them to synchronize
the audio and video streams.
MPEG video compression takes advantage of two kinds of redundancies that
exist in movies: spatial and temporal. Spatial redundancy can be utilized by sim-
ply coding each frame separately with JPEG. This approach is occasionally used,
especially when random access to each frame is needed, as in editing video prod-
uctions. In this mode, JPEG levels of compression are achieved.
Additional compression can be achieved by taking advantage of the fact that
consecutive frames are often almost identical. This effect is smaller than it might
first appear since many movie directors cut between scenes every 3 or 4 seconds
(time a movie fragment and count the scenes). Nevertheless, runs of 75 or more
highly similar frames offer the potential of a major reduction over simply en-
coding each frame separately with JPEG.
For scenes in which the camera and background are stationary and one or two
actors are moving around slowly, nearly all the pixels will be identical from frame
to frame. Here, just subtracting each frame from the previous one and running

JPEG on the difference would do fine. However, for scenes where the camera is
panning or zooming, this technique fails badly. What is needed is some way to
compensate for this motion. This is precisely what MPEG does; it is the main dif-
ference between MPEG and JPEG.
MPEG output consists of three kinds of frames:
1. I- (Intracoded) frames: self-contained compressed still pictures.
2. P- (Predictive) frames: block-by-block difference with the previous
frames.
3. B- (Bidirectional) frames: block-by-block differences between previ-
ous and future frames.
I-frames are just still pictures. They can be coded with JPEG or something
similar. It is valuable to have I-frames appear in the output stream periodically
(e.g., once or twice per second) for three reasons. First, MPEG can be used for a
multicast transmission, with viewers tuning in at will. If all frames depended on
their predecessors going back to the first frame, anybody who missed the first
frame could never decode any subsequent frames. Second, if any frame were re-
ceived in error, no further decoding would be possible: everything from then on
would be unintelligble junk. Third, without I-frames, while doing a fast forward
or rewind the decoder would have to calculate every frame passed over so it
would know the full value of the one it stopped on.
P-frames, in contrast, code interframe differences. They are based on the idea
of macroblocks, which cover, for example, 16 × 16 pixels in luminance space and
8 × 8 pixels in chrominance space. A macroblock is encoded by searching the
previous frame for it or something only slightly different from it.
An example of where P-frames would be useful is given in Fig. 7-49. Here
we see three consecutive frames that have the same background, but differ in the
position of one person. The macroblocks containing the background scene will
match exactly, but the macroblocks containing the person will be offset in posi-
tion by some unknown amount and will have to be tracked down.
Figure 7-49. Three consecutive frames.
The MPEG standards do not specify how to search, how far to search, or how
good a match has to be in order to count. This is up to each implementation. For

---

## Page 102

712

CHAP. 7
example, an implementation might search for a macroblock at the current position
in the previous frame, and all other positions offset ± Δx in the x direction and
± Δy in the y direction. For each position, the number of matches in the luminance
matrix could be computed. The position with the highest score would be declared
the winner, provided it was above some predefined threshold. Otherwise, the
macroblock would be said to be missing. Much more sophisticated algorithms are
also possible, of course.
If a macroblock is found, it is encoded by taking the difference between its
current value and the one in the previous frame (for luminance and both chromi-
nances).
These difference matrices are then subjected to the discrete cosine
transformation, quantization, run-length encoding, and Huffman encoding, as
usual. The value for the macroblock in the output stream is then the motion vec-
tor (how far the macroblock moved from its previous position in each direction),
followed by the encoding of its difference. If the macroblock is not located in the
previous frame, the current value is encoded, just as in an I-frame.
Clearly, this algorithm is highly asymmetric. An implementation is free to try
every plausible position in the previous frame if it wants to, in a desperate attempt
to locate every last macroblock, no matter where it has moved to. This approach
will minimize the encoded MPEG stream at the expense of very slow encoding.
This approach might be fine for a one-time encoding of a film library but would
be terrible for real-time videoconferencing.
Similarly, each implementation is free to decide what constitutes a ‘‘found’’
macroblock. This freedom allows implementers to compete on the quality and
speed of their algorithms, but always produce compliant MPEG output.
So far, decoding MPEG is straightforward. Decoding I-frames is similar to
decoding JPEG images. Decoding P-frames requires the decoder to buffer the
previous frames so it can build up the new one in a separate buffer based on fully
encoded macroblocks and macroblocks containing differences from the previous
frames. The new frame is assembled macroblock by macroblock.
B-frames are similar to P-frames, except that they allow the reference macro-
block to be in either previous frames or succeeding frames. This additional free-
dom allows for improved motion compensation. It is useful, for example, when
objects pass in front of, or behind, other objects. To do B-frame encoding, the en-
coder needs to hold a sequence of frames in memory at once: past frames, the cur-
rent frame being encoded, and future frames. Decoding is similarly more compli-
cated and adds some delay. This is because a given B-frame cannot be decoded
until the successive frames on which it depends are decoded. Thus, although B-
frames give the best compression, they are not always used due to their greater
complexity and buffering requirements.
The MPEG standards contain many enhancements to these techniques to
achieve excellent levels of compression. AVC can be used to compress video at
ratios in excess of 50:1, which reduces network bandwidth requirements by the
same factor. For more information on AVC, see Sullivan and Wiegand (2005).

7.4.3 Streaming Stored Media
Let us now move on to network applications. Our first case is streaming me-
dia that is already stored in files. The most common example of this is watching
videos over the Internet. This is one form of VoD (Video on Demand). Other
forms of video on demand use a provider network that is separate from the Inter-
net to deliver the movies (e.g., the cable network).
In the next section, we will look at streaming live media, for example, broad-
cast IPTV and Internet radio. Then we will look at the third case of real-time con-
ferencing. An example is a voice-over-IP call or video conference with Skype.
These three cases place increasingly stringent requirements on how we can deliv-
er the audio and video over the network because we must pay increasing attention
to delay and jitter.
The Internet is full of music and video sites that stream stored media files.
Actually, the easiest way to handle stored media is not to stream it. Imagine you
want to create an online movie rental site to compete with Apple’s iTunes. A reg-
ular Web site will let users download and then watch videos (after they pay, of
course). The sequence of steps is shown in Fig. 7-50. We will spell them out to
contrast them with the next example.

Figure 7-50. Playing media over the Web via simple downloads.
The browser goes into action when the user clicks on a movie. In step 1, it
sends an HTTP request for the movie to the Web server to which the movie is
linked. In step 2, the server fetches the movie (which is just a file in MP4 or some
other format) and sends it back to the browser. Using the MIME type, for ex-
ample, video/mp4, the browser looks up how it is supposed to display the file. In
this case, it is with a media player that is shown as a helper application, though it
could also be a plug-in. The browser saves the entire movie to a scratch file on
disk in step 3. It then starts the media player, passing it the name of the scratch
file. Finally, in step 4 the media player starts reading the file and playing the
movie.
In principle, this approach is completely correct. It will play the movie. There
is no real-time network issue to address either because the download is simply a

file download. The only trouble is that the entire video must be transmitted over
the network before the movie starts. Most customers do not want to wait an hour
for their ‘‘video on demand.’’ This model can be problematic even for audio. Im-
agine previewing a song before purchasing an album. If the song is 4 MB, which
is a typical size for an MP3 song, and the broadband connectivity is 1 Mbps, the
user will be greeted by half a minute of silence before the preview starts. This
model is unlikely to sell many albums.
To get around this problem without changing how the browser works, sites
can use the design shown in Fig. 7-51. The page linked to the movie is not the ac-
tual movie file. Instead, it is what is called a metafile, a very short file just na-
ming the movie (and possibly having other key descriptors). A simple metafile
might be only one line of ASCII text and look like this:
rtsp://joes-movie-server/movie-0025.mp4
The browser gets the page as usual, now a one-line file, in steps 1 and 2. Then it
starts the media player and hands it the one-line file in step 3, all as usual. The
media player reads the metafile and sees the URL of where to get the movie. It
contacts joes-video-server and asks for the movie in step 4. The movie is then
streamed back to the media player in step 5. The advantage of this arrangement is
that the media player starts quickly, after only a very short metafile is download-
ed. Once this happens, the browser is not in the loop any more. The media is sent
directly to the media player, which can start showing the movie before the entire
file has been downloaded.

an HTTP server, but a specialized media server. In this example, the media server
uses RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol), as indicated by the scheme name
rtsp.
The media player has four major jobs to do:
1. Manage the user interface.
2. Handle transmission errors.
3. Decompress the content.
4. Eliminate jitter.
Most media players nowadays have a glitzy user interface, sometimes simulating
a stereo unit, with buttons, knobs, sliders, and visual displays. Often there are
interchangeable front panels, called skins, that the user can drop onto the player.
The media player has to manage all this and interact with the user.
The other jobs are related and depend on the network protocols. We will go
through each one in turn, starting with handling transmission errors. Dealing with
errors depends on whether a TCP-based transport like HTTP is used to transport
the media, or a UDP-based transport like RTP is used. Both are used in practice.
If a TCP-based transport is being used then there are no errors for the media
player to correct because TCP already provides reliability by using retransmis-
sions. This is an easy way to handle errors, at least for the media player, but it
does complicate the removal of jitter in a later step.
Alternatively, a UDP-based transport like RTP can be used to move the data.
We studied it in Chap. 6. With these protocols, there are no retransmissions.
Thus, packet loss due to congestion or transmission errors will mean that some of
the media does not arrive. It is up to the media player to deal with this problem.
Let us understand the difficulty we are up against. The loss is a problem be-
cause customers do not like large gaps in their songs or movies. However, it is
not as much of a problem as loss in a regular file transfer because the loss of a
small amount of media need not degrade the presentation for the user. For video,
the user is unlikely to notice if there are occasionally 24 new frames in some sec-
ond instead of 25 new frames. For audio, short gaps in the playout can be masked
with sounds close in time. The user is unlikely to detect this substitution unless
they are paying very close attention.
The key to the above reasoning, however, is that the gaps are very short. Net-
work congestion or a transmission error will generally cause an entire packet to be
lost, and packets are often lost in small bursts. Two strategies can be used to re-
duce the impact of packet loss on the media that is lost: FEC and interleaving. We
will describe each in turn.
FEC (Forward Error Correction) is simply the error-correcting coding that
we studied in Chap. 3 applied at the application level. Parity across packets pro-
vides an example (Shacham and McKenny, 1990). For every four data packets

that are sent, a fifth parity packet can be constructed and sent. This is shown in
Fig. 7-52 with packets A, B, C, and D. The parity packet, P, contains redundant
bits that are the parity or exclusive-OR sums of the bits in each of the four data
packets. Hopefully, all of the packets will arrive for most groups of five packets.
When this happens, the parity packet is simply discarded at the receiver. Or, if
only the parity packet is lost, no harm is done.

Figure 7-52. Using a parity packet to repair loss.
Occasionally, however, a data packet may be lost during transmission, as B is
in Fig. 7-52. The media player receives only three data packets, A, C, and D, plus
the parity packet, P. By design, the bits in the missing data packet can be recon-
structed from the parity bits. To be specific, using ‘‘+’’ to represent exclusive-OR
or modulo 2 addition, B can be reconstructed as B = P + A + C + D by the proper-
ties of exclusive-OR (i.e., X + Y + Y = X).
FEC can reduce the level of loss seen by the media player by repairing some
of the packet losses, but it only works up to a certain level. If two packets in a
group of five are lost, there is nothing we can do to recover the data. The other
property to note about FEC is the cost that we have paid to gain this protection.
Every four packets have become five packets, so the bandwidth requirements for
the media are 25% larger. The latency of decoding has increased too, as we may
need to wait until the parity packet has arrived before we can reconstruct a data
packet that came before it.
There is also one clever trick in the technique above. In Chap. 3, we de-
scribed parity as providing error detection. Here we are providing error-cor-
rection. How can it do both? The answer is that in this case it is known which
packet was lost. The lost data is called an erasure. In Chap. 3, when we consid-
ered a frame that was received with some bits in error, we did not know which bit
was errored. This case is harder to deal with than erasures. Thus, with erasures
parity can provide error correction, and without erasures parity can only provide
error detection. We will see another unexpected benefit of parity soon, when we
get to multicast scenarios.
The second strategy is called interleaving. This approach is based on mixing
up or interleaving the order of the media before transmission and unmixing or

---

717
deinterleaving it on reception. That way, if a packet (or burst of packets) is lost,
the loss will be spread out over time by the unmixing. It will not result in a single,
large gap when the media is played out. For example, a packet might contain 220
stereo samples, each containing a pair of 16-bit numbers, normally good for 5
msec of music. If the samples were sent in order, a lost packet would represent a
5 msec gap in the music. Instead, the samples are transmitted as shown in Fig. 7-
53. All the even samples for a 10-msec interval are sent in one packet, followed
by all the odd samples in the next one. The loss of packet 3 now does not repres-
ent a 5-msec gap in the music, but the loss of every other sample for 10 msec.
This loss can be handled easily by having the media player interpolate using the
previous and succeeding samples. The result is lower temporal resolution for 10
msec, but not a noticeable time gap in the media.

Figure 7-53. When packets carry alternate samples, the loss of a packet reduces
the temporal resolution rather than creating a gap in time.
This interleaving scheme above only works with uncompressed sampling.
However, interleaving (over short periods of time, not individual samples) can
also be applied after compression as long as there is a way to find sample bound-
aries in the compressed stream.
RFC 3119 gives a scheme that works with
compressed audio.
Interleaving is an attractive technique when it can be used because it needs no
additional bandwidth, unlike FEC. However, interleaving adds to the latency, just
like FEC, because of the need to wait for a group of packets to arrive (so they can
be de-interleaved).
The media player’s third job is decompressing the content. Although this task
is computationally intensive, it is fairly straightforward. The thorny issue is how
to decode media if the network protocol does not correct transmission errors. In
many compression schemes, later data cannot be decompressed until the earlier
data has been decompressed, because the later data is encoded relative to the ear-
lier data. For a UDP-based transport, there can be packet loss. Thus, the encoding

CHAP. 7
process must be designed to permit decoding despite packet loss. This require-
ment is why MPEG uses I-, P- and B-frames. Each I-frame can be decoded inde-
pendently of the other frames to recover from the loss of any earlier frames.
The fourth job is to eliminate jitter, the bane of all real-time systems. The
general solution that we described in Sec. 6.4.3 is to use a playout buffer. All
streaming systems start by buffering 5–10 sec worth of media before starting to
play, as shown in Fig. 7-54. Playing drains media regularly from the buffer so
that the audio is clear and the video is smooth. The startup delay gives the buffer
a chance to fill to the low-water mark. The idea is that data should now arrive
regularly enough that the buffer is never completely emptied. If that were to hap-
pen, the media playout would stall. The value of buffering is that if the data are
sometimes slow to arrive due to congestion, the buffered media will allow the
playout to continue normally until new media arrive and the buffer is replenished.

Figure 7-54. The media player buffers input from the media server and plays
from the buffer rather than directly from the network.
How much buffering is needed, and how fast the media server sends media to
fill up the buffer, depend on the network protocols. There are many possibilities.
The largest factor in the design is whether a UDP-based transport or a TCP-based
transport is used.
Suppose that a UDP-based transport like RTP is used. Further suppose that
there is ample bandwidth to send packets from the media server to the media
player with little loss, and little other traffic in the network. In this case, packets
can be sent at the exact rate that the media is being played. Each packet will tran-
sit the network and, after a propagation delay, arrive at about the right time for the
media player to present the media. Very little buffering is needed, as there is no
variability in delay. If interleaving or FEC is used, more buffering is needed for at
least the group of packets over which the interleaving or FEC is performed. How-
ever, this adds only a small amount of buffering.
Unfortunately, this scenario is unrealistic in two respects. First, bandwidth
varies over network paths, so it is usually not clear to the media server whether
there will be sufficient bandwidth before it tries to stream the media. A simple
solution is to encode media at multiple resolutions and let each user choose a

719
resolution that is supported by his Internet connectivity. Often there are just two
levels: high quality, say, encoded at 1.5 Mbps or better, and low quality, say en-
coded at 512 kbps or less.
Second, there will be some jitter, or variation in how long it takes media sam-
ples to cross the network. This jitter comes from two sources. There is often an
appreciable amount of competing traffic in the network—some of which can
come from multitasking users themselves browsing the Web while ostensibly
watching a streamed movie). This traffic will cause fluctuations in when the
media arrives. Moreover, we care about the arrival of video frames and audio
samples, not packets. With compression, video frames in particular may be larger
or smaller depending on their content. An action sequence will typically take
more bits to encode than a placid landscape. If the network bandwidth is con-
stant, the rate of media delivery versus time will vary. The more jitter, or varia-
tion in delay, from these sources, the larger the low-water mark of the buffer
needs to be to avoid underrun.
Now suppose that a TCP-based transport like HTTP is used to send the media.
By performing retransmissions and waiting to deliver packets until they are in
order, TCP will increase the jitter that is observed by the media player, perhaps
significantly. The result is that a larger buffer and higher low-water mark are
needed. However, there is an advantage. TCP will send data as fast as the network
will carry it. Sometimes media may be delayed if loss must be repaired. But much
of the time, the network will be able to deliver media faster than the player con-
sumes it. In these periods, the buffer will fill and prevent future underruns. If the
network is significantly faster than the average media rate, as is often the case, the
buffer will fill rapidly after startup such that emptying it will soon cease to be a
concern.
With TCP, or with UDP and a transmission rate that exceeds the playout rate,
a question is how far ahead of the playout point the media player and media server
are willing to proceed. Often they are willing to download the entire file.
However, proceeding far ahead of the playout point performs work that is not
yet needed, may require significant storage, and is not necessary to avoid buffer
underruns. When it is not wanted, the solution is for the media player to define a
high-water mark in the buffer. Basically, the server just pumps out data until the
buffer is filled to the high-water mark. Then the media player tells it to pause.
Since data will continue to pour in until the server has gotten the pause request,
the distance between the high-water mark and the end of the buffer has to be
greater than the bandwidth-delay product of the network. After the server has
stopped, the buffer will begin to empty. When it hits the low-water mark, the
media player tells the media server to start again. To avoid underrun, the low-wa-
ter mark must also take the bandwidth-delay product of the network into account
when asking the media server to resume sending the media.
To start and stop the flow of media, the media player needs a remote control
for it. This is what RTSP provides. It is defined in RFC 2326 and provides the

---

## Page 110

720
THE APPLICATION LAYER

mechanism for the player to control the server. As well as starting and stopping
the stream, it can seek back or forward to a position, play specified intervals, and
play at fast or slow speeds. It does not provide for the data stream, though, which
is usually RTP over UDP or RTP over HTTP over TCP.
The main commands provided by RTSP are listed in Fig. 7-55. They have a
simple text format, like HTTP messages, and are usually carried over TCP. RTSP
can run over UDP too, since each command is acknowledged (and so can be
resent if it is not acknowledged).

Even though TCP would seem a poor fit to real-time traffic, it is often used in
practice. The main reason is that it is able to pass through firewalls more easily
than UDP, especially when run over the HTTP port. Most administrators config-
ure firewalls to protect their networks from unwelcome visitors. They almost al-
ways allow TCP connections from remote port 80 to pass through for HTTP and
Web traffic. Blocking that port quickly leads to unhappy campers. However, most
other ports are blocked, including for RSTP and RTP, which use ports 554 and
5004, amongst others. Thus, the easiest way to get streaming media through the
firewall is for the Web site to pretend it is an HTTP server sending a regular
HTTP response, at least to the firewall.
There are some other advantages of TCP, too. Because it provides reliability,
TCP gives the client a complete copy of the media. This makes it easy for a user
to rewind to a previously viewed playout point without concern for lost data.
Finally, TCP will buffer as much of the media as possible as quickly as possible.
When buffer space is cheap (which it is when the disk is used for storage), the
media player can download the media while the user watches. Once the download
is complete, the user can watch uninterrupted, even if he loses connectivity. This
property is helpful for mobiles because connectivity can change rapidly with
motion.
The disadvantage of TCP is the added startup latency (because of TCP
startup) and also a higher low-water mark. However, this is rarely much of a
penalty as long as the network bandwidth exceeds the media rate by a large factor.

7.4.4 Streaming Live Media
It is not only recorded videos that are tremendously popular on the Web. Live
media streaming is very popular too. Once it became possible to stream audio and
video over the Internet, commercial radio and TV stations got the idea of broad-
casting their content over the Internet as well as over the air. Not so long after
that, college stations started putting their signals out over the Internet. Then col-
lege students started their own Internet broadcasts.
Today, people and companies of all sizes stream live audio and video. The
area is a hotbed of innovation as the technologies and standards evolve. Live
streaming is used for an online presence by major television stations. This is call-
ed IPTV (IP TeleVision). It is also used to broadcast radio stations like the BBC.
This is called Internet radio. Both IPTV and Internet radio reach audiences
worldwide for events ranging from fashion shows to World Cup soccer and test
matches live from the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Live streaming over IP is used
as a technology by cable providers to build their own broadcast systems. And it is
widely used by low-budget operations from adult sites to zoos. With current tech-
nology, virtually anyone can start live streaming quickly and with little expense.
One approach to live streaming is to record programs to disk. Viewers can
connect to the server’s archives, pull up any program, and download it for listen-
ing. A podcast is an episode retrieved in this manner. For scheduled events, it is
also possible to store content just after it is broadcast live, so the archive is only
running, say, half an hour or less behind the live feed.
In fact, this approach is exactly the same as that used for the streaming media
we just discussed. It is easy to do, all the techniques we have discussed work for
it, and viewers can pick and choose among all the programs in the archive.
A different approach is to broadcast live over the Internet. Viewers tune in to
an ongoing media stream, just like turning on the television. However, media
players provide the added features of letting the user pause or rewind the playout.
The live media will continue to be streamed and will be buffered by the player
until the user is ready for it. From the browser’s point of view, it looks exactly
like the case of streaming stored media. It does not matter to the player whether
the content comes from a file or is being sent live, and usually the player will not
be able to tell (except that it is not possible to skip forward with a live stream).
Given the similarity of mechanism, much of our previous discussion applies, but
there are also some key differences.
Importantly, there is still the need for buffering at the client side to smooth out
jitter. In fact, a larger amount of buffering is often needed for live streaming (in-
dependent of the consideration that the user may pause playback). When stream-
ing from a file, the media can be pushed out at a rate that is greater than the play-
back rate. This will build up a buffer quickly to compensate for network jitter
(and the player will stop the stream if it does not want to buffer more data). In
contrast, live media streaming is always transmitted at precisely the rate it is

---

722
THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
generated, which is the same as the rate at which it is played back. It cannot be
sent faster than this. As a consequence, the buffer must be large enough to handle
the full range of network jitter. In practice, a 10–15 second startup delay is usual-
ly adequate, so this is not a large problem.
The other important difference is that live streaming events usually have hun-
dreds or thousands of simultaneous viewers of the same content. Under these cir-
cumstances, the natural solution for live streaming is to use multicasting. This is
not the case for streaming stored media because the users typically stream dif-
ferent content at any given time. Streaming to many users then consists of many
individual streaming sessions that happen to occur at the same time.
A multicast streaming scheme works as follows. The server sends each media
packet once using IP multicast to a group address. The network delivers a copy of
the packet to each member of the group. All of the clients who want to receive the
stream have joined the group. The clients do this using IGMP, rather than sending
an RTSP message to the media server. This is because the media server is already
sending the live stream (except before the first user joins). What is needed is to
arrange for the stream to be received locally.
Since multicast is a one-to-many delivery service, the media is carried in RTP
packets over a UDP transport. TCP only operates between a single sender and a
single receiver. Since UDP does not provide reliability, some packets may be
lost. To reduce the level of media loss to an acceptable level, we can use FEC and
interleaving, as before.
In the case of FEC, there is a beneficial interaction with multicast that is
shown in the parity example of Fig. 7-56. When the packets are multicast, dif-
ferent clients may lose different packets. For example, client 1 has lost packet B,
client 2 lost the parity packet P, client 3 lost D, and client 4 did not lose any pack-
ets. However, even though three different packets are lost across the clients, each
client can recover all of the data packets in this example. All that is required is
that each client lose no more than one packet, whichever one it may be, so that the
missing packet can be recovered by a parity computation. Nonnenmacher et al.
(1997) describe how this idea can be used to boost reliability.
For a server with a large number of clients, multicast of media in RTP and
UDP packets is clearly the most efficient way to operate. Otherwise, the server
must transmit N streams when it has N clients, which will require a very large
amount of network bandwidth at the server for large streaming events.
It may surprise you to learn that the Internet does not work like this in prac-
tice. What usually happens is that each user establishes a separate TCP con-
nection to the server, and the media is streamed over that connection. To the cli-
ent, this is the same as streaming stored media. And as with streaming stored
media, there are several reasons for this seemingly poor choice.
The first reason is that IP multicast is not broadly available on the Internet.
Some ISPs and networks support it internally, but it is usually not available across
network boundaries as is needed for wide-area streaming. The other reasons are

the same advantages of TCP over UDP as discussed earlier. Streaming with TCP
will reach nearly all clients on the Internet, particularly when disguised as HTTP
to pass through firewalls, and reliable media delivery allows users to rewind easi-
ly.
There is one important case in which UDP and multicast can be used for
streaming, however: within a provider network. For example, a cable company
might decide to broadcast TV channels to customer set-top boxes using IP tech-
nology instead of traditional video broadcasts. The use of IP to distribute broad-
cast video is broadly called IPTV, as discussed above. Since the cable company
has complete control of its own network, it can engineer it to support IP multicast
and have sufficient bandwidth for UDP-based distribution. All of this is invisible
to the customer, as the IP technology exists within the walled garden of the pro-
vider. It looks just like cable TV in terms of service, but it is IP underneath, with
the set-top box being a computer running UDP and the TV set being simply a
monitor attached to the computer.
Back to the Internet case, the disadvantage of live streaming over TCP is that
the server must send a separate copy of the media for each client. This is feasible
for a moderate number of clients, especially for audio. The trick is to place the
server at a location with good Internet connectivity so that there is sufficient band-
width. Usually this means renting a server in a data center from a hosting pro-
vider, not using a server at home with only broadband Internet connectivity.
There is a very competitive hosting market, so this need not be expensive.
In fact, it is easy for anybody, even a student, to set up and operate a stream-
ing media server such as an Internet radio station. The main components of this

station are illustrated in Fig. 7-57. The basis of the station is an ordinary PC with
a decent sound card and microphone. Popular software is used to capture audio
and encode it in various formats, for example, MP4, and media players are used to
listen to the audio as usual.

The audio stream captured on the PC is then fed over the Internet to a media
server with good network connectivity, either as podcasts for stored file streaming
or for live streaming. The server handles the task of distributing the media via
large numbers of TCP connections. It also presents a front-end Web site with
pages about the station and links to the content that is available for streaming.
There are commercial software packages for managing all the pieces, as well as
open source packages such as icecast.
However, for a very large number of clients, it becomes infeasible to use TCP
to send media to each client from a single server. There is simply not enough
bandwidth to the one server. For large streaming sites, the streaming is done using
a set of servers that are geographically spread out, so that a client can connect to
the nearest server. This is a content distribution network that we will study at the
end of the chapter.
7.4.5 Real-Time Conferencing
Once upon a time, voice calls were carried over the public switched telephone
network, and network traffic was primarily voice traffic, with a little bit of data
traffic here and there. Then came the Internet, and the Web. The data traffic grew
and grew, until by 1999 there was as much data traffic as voice traffic (since voice
is now digitized, both can be measured in bits). By 2002, the volume of data traf-
fic was an order of magnitude more than the volume of voice traffic and still
growing exponentially, with voice traffic staying almost flat.
The consequence of this growth has been to flip the telephone network on its
head. Voice traffic is now carried using Internet technologies, and represents only

SEC. 7.4
STREAMING AUDIO AND VIDEO
725
a tiny fraction of the network bandwidth. This disruptive technology is known as
voice over IP, and also as Internet telephony.
Voice-over-IP is used in several forms that are driven by strong economic fac-
tors. (English translation: it saves money so people use it.) One form is to have
what look like regular (old-fashioned?) telephones that plug into the Ethernet and
send calls over the network. Pehr Anderson was an undergraduate student at
M.I.T. when he and his friends prototyped this design for a class project. They
got a ‘‘B’’ grade. Not content, he started a company called NBX in 1996,
pioneered this kind of voice over IP, and sold it to 3Com for $90 million three
years later. Companies love this approach because it lets them do away with sep-
arate telephone lines and make do with the networks that they have already.
Another approach is to use IP technology to build a long-distance telephone
network. In countries such as the U.S., this network can be accessed for competi-
tive long-distance service by dialing a special prefix. Voice samples are put into
packets that are injected into the network and pulled out of the packets when they
leave it. Since IP equipment is much cheaper than telecommunications equipment
this leads to cheaper services.
As an aside, the difference in price is not entirely technical. For many dec-
ades, telephone service was a regulated monopoly that guaranteed the phone com-
panies a fixed percentage profit over their costs. Not surprisingly, this led them to
run up costs, for example, by having lots and lots of redundant hardware, justified
in the name of better reliability (the telephone system was only allowed to be
down for a total of 2 hours every 40 years, or 3 min/year on average). This effect
was often referred to as the ‘‘gold-plated telephone pole syndrome.’’ Since dereg-
ulation, the effect has decreased, of course, but legacy equipment still exists. The
IT industry never had any history operating like this, so it has always been lean
and mean.
However, we will concentrate on the form of voice over IP that is likely the
most visible to users: using one computer to call another computer. This form
became commonplace as PCs began shipping with microphones, speakers, cam-
eras, and CPUs fast enough to process media, and people started connecting to the
Internet from home at broadband rates. A well-known example is the Skype soft-
ware that was released starting in 2003. Skype and other companies also provide
gateways to make it easy to call regular telephone numbers as well as computers
with IP addresses.
As network bandwidth increased, video calls joined voice calls. Initially,
video calls were in the domain of companies. Videoconferencing systems were
designed to exchange video between two or more locations enabling executives at
different locations to see each other while they held their meetings. However,
with good broadband Internet connectivity and video compression software, home
users can also videoconference. Tools such as Skype that started as audio-only
now routinely include video with the calls so that friends and family across the
world can see as well as hear each other.

From our point of view, Internet voice or video calls are also a media stream-
ing problem, but one that is much more constrained than streaming a stored file or
a live event. The added constraint is the low latency that is needed for a two-way
conversation. The telephone network allows a one-way latency of up to 150 msec
for acceptable usage, after which delay begins to be perceived as annoying by the
participants. (International calls may have a latency of up to 400 msec, by which
point they are far from a positive user experience.)
This low latency is difficult to achieve. Certainly, buffering 5–10 seconds of
media is not going to work (as it would for broadcasting a live sports event). In-
stead, video and voice-over-IP systems must be engineered with a variety of tech-
niques to minimize latency. This goal means starting with UDP as the clear choice
rather than TCP, because TCP retransmissions introduce at least one round-trip
worth of delay. Some forms of latency cannot be reduced, however, even with
UDP. For example, the distance between Seattle and Amsterdam is close to
8,000 km. The speed-of-light propagation delay for this distance in optical fiber is
40 msec. Good luck beating that. In practice, the propagation delay through the
network will be longer because it will cover a larger distance (the bits do not fol-
low a great circle route) and have transmission delays as each IP router stores and
forwards a packet. This fixed delay eats into the acceptable delay budget.
Another source of latency is related to packet size. Normally, large packets
are the best way to use network bandwidth because they are more efficient. How-
ever, at an audio sampling rate of 64 kbps, a 1-KB packet would take 125 msec to
fill (and even longer if the samples are compressed). This delay would consume
most of the overall delay budget. In addition, if the 1-KB packet is sent over a
broadband access link that runs at just 1 Mbps, it will take 8 msec to transmit.
Then add another 8 msec for the packet to go over the broadband link at the other
end. Clearly, large packets will not work.
Instead, voice-over-IP systems use short packets to reduce latency at the cost
of bandwidth efficiency. They batch audio samples in smaller units, commonly
20 msec. At 64 kbps, this is 160 bytes of data, less with compression. However,
by definition the delay from this packetization will be 20 msec. The transmission
delay will be smaller as well because the packet is shorter. In our example, it
would reduce to around 1 msec. By using short packets, the minimum one-way
delay for a Seattle-to-Amsterdam packet has been reduced from an unacceptable
181 msec (40 + 125 + 16) to an acceptable 62 msec (40 + 20 + 2).
We have not even talked about the software overhead, but it, too, will eat up
some of the delay budget. This is especially true for video, since compression is
usually needed to fit video into the available bandwidth. Unlike streaming from a
stored file, there is no time to have a computationally intensive encoder for high
levels of compression. The encoder and the decoder must both run quickly.
Buffering is still needed to play out the media samples on time (to avoid unin-
telligible audio or jerky video), but the amount of buffering must be kept very
small since the time remaining in our delay budget is measured in milliseconds.

When a packet takes too long to arrive, the player will skip over the missing sam-
ples, perhaps playing ambient noise or repeating a frame to mask the loss to the
user. There is a trade-off between the size of the buffer used to handle jitter and
the amount of media that is lost. A smaller buffer reduces latency but results in
more loss due to jitter. Eventually, as the size of the buffer shrinks, the loss will
become noticeable to the user.
Observant readers may have noticed that we have said nothing about the net-
work layer protocols so far in this section. The network can reduce latency, or at
least jitter, by using quality of service mechanisms. The reason that this issue has
not come up before is that streaming is able to operate with substantial latency,
even in the live streaming case. If latency is not a major concern, a buffer at the
end host is sufficient to handle the problem of jitter. However, for real-time con-
ferencing, it is usually important to have the network reduce delay and jitter to
help meet the delay budget. The only time that it is not important is when there is
so much network bandwidth that everyone gets good service.
In Chap. 5, we described two quality of service mechanisms that help with
this goal. One mechanism is DS (Differentiated Services), in which packets are
marked as belonging to different classes that receive different handling within the
network. The appropriate marking for voice-over-IP packets is low delay. In
practice, systems set the DS codepoint to the well-known value for the Expedited
Forwarding class with Low Delay type of service. This is especially useful over
broadband access links, as these links tend to be congested when Web traffic or
other traffic competes for use of the link. Given a stable network path, delay and
jitter are increased by congestion. Every 1-KB packet takes 8 msec to send over a
1-Mbps link, and a voice-over-IP packet will incur these delays if it is sitting in a
queue behind Web traffic. However, with a low delay marking the voice-over-IP
packets will jump to the head of the queue, bypassing the Web packets and lower-
ing their delay.
The second mechanism that can reduce delay is to make sure that there is suf-
ficient bandwidth. If the available bandwidth varies or the transmission rate fluc-
tuates (as with compressed video) and there is sometimes not sufficient band-
width, queues will build up and add to the delay. This will occur even with DS.
To ensure sufficient bandwidth, a reservation can be made with the network. This
capability is provided by integrated services. Unfortunately, it is not widely de-
ployed. Instead, networks are engineered for an expected traffic level or network
customers are provided with service-level agreements for a given traffic level.
Applications must operate below this level to avoid causing congestion and intro-
ducing unnecessary delays. For casual videoconferencing at home, the user may
choose a video quality as a proxy for bandwidth needs, or the software may test
the network path and select an appropriate quality automatically.
Any of the above factors can cause the latency to become unacceptable, so
real-time conferencing requires that attention be paid to all of them. For an over-
view of voice over IP and analysis of these factors, see Goode (2002).

Now that we have discussed the problem of latency in the media streaming
path, we will move on to the other main problem that conferencing systems must
address. This problem is how to set up and tear down calls. We will look at two
protocols that are widely used for this purpose, H.323 and SIP. Skype is another
important system, but its inner workings are proprietary.
H.323
One thing that was clear to everyone before voice and video calls were made
over the Internet was that if each vendor designed its own protocol stack, the sys-
tem would never work. To avoid this problem, a number of interested parties got
together under ITU auspices to work out standards. In 1996, ITU issued recom-
mendation H.323, entitled ‘‘Visual Telephone Systems and Equipment for Local
Area Networks Which Provide a Non-Guaranteed Quality of Service.’’ Only the
telephone industry would think of such a name. It was quickly changed to ‘‘Pack-
et-based Multimedia Communications Systems’’ in the 1998 revision. H.323 was
the basis for the first widespread Internet conferencing systems. It remains the
most widely deployed solution, in its seventh version as of 2009.
H.323 is more of an architectural overview of Internet telephony than a spe-
cific protocol. It references a large number of specific protocols for speech cod-
ing, call setup, signaling, data transport, and other areas rather than specifying
these things itself. The general model is depicted in Fig. 7-58. At the center is a
gateway that connects the Internet to the telephone network. It speaks the H.323
protocols on the Internet side and the PSTN protocols on the telephone side. The
communicating devices are called terminals. A LAN may have a gatekeeper,
which controls the end points under its jurisdiction, called a zone.

A telephone network needs a number of protocols. To start with, there is a
protocol for encoding and decoding audio and video. Standard telephony repres-
entations of a single voice channel as 64 kbps of digital audio (8000 samples of 8
bits per second) are defined in ITU recommendation G.711. All H.323 systems

must support G.711. Other encodings that compress speech are permitted, but not
required. They use different compression algorithms and make different trade-
offs between quality and bandwidth. For video, the MPEG forms of video com-
pression that we described above are supported, including H.264.
Since multiple compression algorithms are permitted, a protocol is needed to
allow the terminals to negotiate which one they are going to use. This protocol is
called H.245. It also negotiates other aspects of the connection such as the bit
rate. RTCP is need for the control of the RTP channels. Also required is a proto-
col for establishing and releasing connections, providing dial tones, making ring-
ing sounds, and the rest of the standard telephony. ITU Q.931 is used here. The
terminals need a protocol for talking to the gatekeeper (if present) as well. For
this purpose, H.225 is used. The PC-to-gatekeeper channel it manages is called
the RAS (Registration/Admission/Status) channel. This channel allows termi-
nals to join and leave the zone, request and return bandwidth, and provide status
updates, among other things. Finally, a protocol is needed for the actual data
transmission. RTP over UDP is used for this purpose. It is managed by RTCP, as
usual. The positioning of all these protocols is shown in Fig. 7-59.

To see how these protocols fit together, consider the case of a PC terminal on
a LAN (with a gatekeeper) calling a remote telephone. The PC first has to dis-
cover the gatekeeper, so it broadcasts a UDP gatekeeper discovery packet to port
1718. When the gatekeeper responds, the PC learns the gatekeeper’s IP address.
Now the PC registers with the gatekeeper by sending it a RAS message in a UDP
packet. After it has been accepted, the PC sends the gatekeeper a RAS admission
message requesting bandwidth. Only after bandwidth has been granted may call
setup begin. The idea of requesting bandwidth in advance is to allow the gate-
keeper to limit the number of calls. It can then avoid oversubscribing the out-
going line in order to help provide the necessary quality of service.

As an aside, the telephone system does the same thing. When you pick up the
receiver, a signal is sent to the local end office. If the office has enough spare ca-
pacity for another call, it generates a dial tone. If not, you hear nothing. Nowa-
days, the system is so overdimensioned that the dial tone is nearly always in-
stantaneous, but in the early days of telephony, it often took a few seconds. So if
your grandchildren ever ask you ‘‘Why are there dial tones?’’ now you know. Ex-
cept by then, probably telephones will no longer exist.
The PC now establishes a TCP connection to the gatekeeper to begin call
setup. Call setup uses existing telephone network protocols, which are connection
oriented, so TCP is needed. In contrast, the telephone system has nothing like
RAS to allow telephones to announce their presence, so the H.323 designers were
free to use either UDP or TCP for RAS, and they chose the lower-overhead UDP.
Now that it has bandwidth allocated, the PC can send a Q.931 SETUP mes-
sage over the TCP connection. This message specifies the number of the tele-
phone being called (or the IP address and port, if a computer is being called). The
gatekeeper responds with a Q.931 CALL PROCEEDING message to acknowledge
correct receipt of the request. The gatekeeper then forwards the SETUP message
to the gateway.
The gateway, which is half computer, half telephone switch, then makes an
ordinary telephone call to the desired (ordinary) telephone. The end office to
which the telephone is attached rings the called telephone and also sends back a
Q.931 ALERT message to tell the calling PC that ringing has begun. When the
person at the other end picks up the telephone, the end office sends back a Q.931
CONNECT message to signal the PC that it has a connection.
Once the connection has been established, the gatekeeper is no longer in the
loop, although the gateway is, of course. Subsequent packets bypass the gate-
keeper and go directly to the gateway’s IP address. At this point, we just have a
bare tube running between the two parties. This is just a physical layer con-
nection for moving bits, no more. Neither side knows anything about the other
one.
The H.245 protocol is now used to negotiate the parameters of the call. It
uses the H.245 control channel, which is always open. Each side starts out by
announcing its capabilities, for example, whether it can handle video (H.323 can
handle video) or conference calls, which codecs it supports, etc. Once each side
knows what the other one can handle, two unidirectional data channels are set up
and a codec and other parameters are assigned to each one. Since each side may
have different equipment, it is entirely possible that the codecs on the forward and
reverse channels are different. After all negotiations are complete, data flow can
begin using RTP. It is managed using RTCP, which plays a role in congestion
control. If video is present, RTCP handles the audio/video synchronization. The
various channels are shown in Fig. 7-60. When either party hangs up, the Q.931
call signaling channel is used to tear down the connection after the call has been
completed in order to free up resources no longer needed.

When the call is terminated, the calling PC contacts the gatekeeper again with
a RAS message to release the bandwidth it has been assigned. Alternatively, it
can make another call.
We have not said anything about quality of service as part of H.323, even
though we have said it is an important part of making real-time conferencing a
success. The reason is that QoS falls outside the scope of H.323. If the underly-
ing network is capable of producing a stable, jitter-free connection from the cal-
ling PC to the gateway, the QoS on the call will be good; otherwise, it will not be.
However, any portion of the call on the telephone side will be jitter-free, because
that is how the telephone network is designed.
SIP—The Session Initiation Protocol
H.323 was designed by ITU. Many people in the Internet community saw it
as a typical telco product: large, complex, and inflexible. Consequently, IETF set
up a committee to design a simpler and more modular way to do voice over IP.
The major result to date is SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). The latest version
is described in RFC 3261, which was written in 2002. This protocol describes
how to set up Internet telephone calls, video conferences, and other multimedia
connections. Unlike H.323, which is a complete protocol suite, SIP is a single
module, but it has been designed to interwork well with existing Internet applica-
tions. For example, it defines telephone numbers as URLs, so that Web pages can
contain them, allowing a click on a link to initiate a telephone call (the same way
the mailto scheme allows a click on a link to bring up a program to send an email
message).
SIP can establish two-party sessions (ordinary telephone calls), multiparty
sessions (where everyone can hear and speak), and multicast sessions (one sender,
many receivers). The sessions may contain audio, video, or data, the latter being
useful for multiplayer real-time games, for example. SIP just handles setup, man-
agement, and termination of sessions. Other protocols, such as RTP/RTCP, are

---

THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
also used for data transport. SIP is an application-layer protocol and can run over
UDP or TCP, as required.
SIP supports a variety of services, including locating the callee (who may not
be at his home machine) and determining the callee’s capabilities, as well as han-
dling the mechanics of call setup and termination. In the simplest case, SIP sets
up a session from the caller’s computer to the callee’s computer, so we will exam-
ine that case first.
Telephone numbers in SIP are represented as URLs using the sip scheme, for
example, sip:ilse@cs.university.edu for a user named Ilse at the host specified by
the DNS name cs.university.edu. SIP URLs may also contain IPv4 addresses,
IPv6 addresses, or actual telephone numbers.
The SIP protocol is a text-based protocol modeled on HTTP. One party sends
a message in ASCII text consisting of a method name on the first line, followed
by additional lines containing headers for passing parameters. Many of the head-
ers are taken from MIME to allow SIP to interwork with existing Internet applica-
tions. The six methods defined by the core specification are listed in Fig. 7-61.
Method
Description
INVITE
Request initiation of a session
ACK
Confirm that a session has been initiated
BYE
Request termination of a session
OPTIONS
Query a host about its capabilities
CANCEL
Cancel a pending request
REGISTER
Inform a redirection server about the user’s current location
Figure 7-61. SIP methods.
To establish a session, the caller either creates a TCP connection with the cal-
lee and sends an INVITE message over it or sends the INVITE message in a UDP
packet. In both cases, the headers on the second and subsequent lines describe the
structure of the message body, which contains the caller’s capabilities, media
types, and formats. If the callee accepts the call, it responds with an HTTP-type
reply code (a three-digit number using the groups of Fig. 7-38, 200 for ac-
ceptance). Following the reply-code line, the callee also may supply information
about its capabilities, media types, and formats.
Connection is done using a three-way handshake, so the caller responds with
an ACK message to finish the protocol and confirm receipt of the 200 message.
Either party may request termination of a session by sending a message with
the BYE method. When the other side acknowledges it, the session is terminated.
The OPTIONS method is used to query a machine about its own capabilities.
It is typically used before a session is initiated to find out if that machine is even
capable of voice over IP or whatever type of session is being contemplated.

The REGISTER method relates to SIP’s ability to track down and connect to a
user who is away from home. This message is sent to a SIP location server that
keeps track of who is where. That server can later be queried to find the user’s
current location. The operation of redirection is illustrated in Fig. 7-62. Here, the
caller sends the INVITE message to a proxy server to hide the possible redirection.
The proxy then looks up where the user is and sends the INVITE message there. It
then acts as a relay for the subsequent messages in the three-way handshake. The
LOOKUP and REPLY messages are not part of SIP; any convenient protocol can
be used, depending on what kind of location server is used.

SIP has a variety of other features that we will not describe here, including
call waiting, call screening, encryption, and authentication. It also has the ability
to place calls from a computer to an ordinary telephone, if a suitable gateway be-
tween the Internet and telephone system is available.
Comparison of H.323 and SIP
Both H.323 and SIP allow two-party and multiparty calls using both com-
puters and telephones as end points. Both support parameter negotiation, en-
cryption, and the RTP/RTCP protocols. A summary of their similarities and dif-
ferences is given in Fig. 7-63.
Although the feature sets are similar, the two protocols differ widely in philo-
sophy. H.323 is a typical, heavyweight, telephone-industry standard, specifying
the complete protocol stack and defining precisely what is allowed and what is
forbidden. This approach leads to very well defined protocols in each layer, eas-
ing the task of interoperability. The price paid is a large, complex, and rigid stan-
dard that is difficult to adapt to future applications.
In contrast, SIP is a typical Internet protocol that works by exchanging short
lines of ASCII text. It is a lightweight module that interworks well with other In-
ternet protocols but less well with existing telephone system signaling protocols.

Because the IETF model of voice over IP is highly modular, it is flexible and can
be adapted to new applications easily. The downside is that is has suffered from
ongoing interoperability problems as people try to interpret what the standard
means.
7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY
The Internet used to be all about communication, like the telephone network.
Early on, academics would communicate with remote machines, logging in over
the network to perform tasks. People have used email to communicate with each
other for a long time, and now use video and voice over IP as well. Since the
Web grew up, however, the Internet has become more about content than commu-
nication. Many people use the Web to find information, and there is a tremendous
amount of peer-to-peer file sharing that is driven by access to movies, music, and
programs. The switch to content has been so pronounced that the majority of In-
ternet bandwidth is now used to deliver stored videos.

---

## Page 125

SEC. 7.5
CONTENT DELIVERY
735
Because the task of distributing content is different from that of communica-
tion, it places different requirements on the network. For example, if Sally wants
to talk to Jitu, she may make a voice-over-IP call to his mobile. The communica-
tion must be with a particular computer; it will do no good to call Paul’s com-
puter. But if Jitu wants to watch his team’s latest cricket match, he is happy to
stream video from whichever computer can provide the service. He does not mind
whether the computer is Sally’s or Paul’s, or, more likely, an unknown server in
the Internet. That is, location does not matter for content, except as it affects per-
formance (and legality).
The other difference is that some Web sites that provide content have become
tremendously popular. YouTube is a prime example. It allows users to share
videos of their own creation on every conceivable topic. Many people want to do
this. The rest of us want to watch. With all of these bandwidth-hungry videos, it
is estimated that YouTube accounts for up to 10% of Internet traffic today.
No single server is powerful or reliable enough to handle such a startling level
of demand. Instead, YouTube and other large content providers build their own
content distribution networks. These networks use data centers spread around the
world to serve content to an extremely large number of clients with good per-
formance and availability.
The techniques that are used for content distribution have been developed
over time. Early in the growth of the Web, its popularity was almost its undoing.
More demands for content led to servers and networks that were frequently
overloaded. Many people began to call the WWW the World Wide Wait.
In response to consumer demand, very large amounts of bandwidth were pro-
visioned in the core of the Internet, and faster broadband connectivity was rolled
out at the edge of the network.
This bandwidth was key to improving per-
formance, but it is only part of the solution. To reduce the endless delays, re-
searchers also developed different architectures to use the bandwidth for distribut-
ing content.
One architecture is a CDN (Content Distribution Network). In it, a pro-
vider sets up a distributed collection of machines at locations inside the Internet
and uses them to serve content to clients. This is the choice of the big players. An
alternative architecture is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) network. In it, a collection of
computers pool their resources to serve content to each other, without separately
provisioned servers or any central point of control. This idea has captured peo-
ple’s imagination because, by acting together, many little players can pack an
enormous punch.
In this section, we will look at the problem of distributing content on the In-
ternet and some of the solutions that are used in practice. After briefly discussing
content popularity and Internet traffic, we will describe how to build powerful
Web servers and use caching to improve performance for Web clients. Then we
will come to the two main architectures for distributing content: CDNs and P2P
networks. There design and properties are quite different, as we will see.

7.5.1 Content and Internet Traffic
To design and engineer networks that work well, we need an understanding of
the traffic that they must carry. With the shift to content, for example, servers
have migrated from company offices to Internet data centers that provide large
numbers of machines with excellent network connectivity. To run even a small
server nowadays, it is easier and cheaper to rent a virtual server hosted in an Inter-
net data center than to operate a real machine in a home or office with broadband
connectivity to the Internet.
Fortunately, there are only two facts about Internet traffic that is it essential to
know. The first fact is that it changes quickly, not only in the details but in the
overall makeup. Before 1994, most traffic was traditional FTP file transfer (for
moving programs and data sets between computers) and email. Then the Web ar-
rived and grew exponentially. Web traffic left FTP and email traffic in the dust
long before the dot com bubble of 2000. Starting around 2000, P2P file sharing for
music and then movies took off. By 2003, most Internet traffic was P2P traffic,
leaving the Web in the dust. Sometime in the late 2000s, video streamed using
content distribution methods by sites like YouTube began to exceed P2P traffic.
By 2014, Cisco predicts that 90% of all Internet traffic will be video in one form
or another (Cisco, 2010).
It is not always traffic volume that matters. For instance, while voice-over-IP
traffic boomed even before Skype started in 2003, it will always be a minor blip
on the chart because the bandwidth requirements of audio are two orders of mag-
nitude lower than for video. However, voice-over-IP traffic stresses the network
in other ways because it is sensitive to latency. As another example, online social
networks have grown furiously since Facebook started in 2004. In 2010, for the
first time, Facebook reached more users on the Web per day than Google. Even
putting the traffic aside (and there is an awful lot of traffic), online social net-
works are important because they are changing the way that people interact via
the Internet.
The point we are making is that seismic shifts in Internet traffic happen quick-
ly, and with some regularity. What will come next? Please check back in the 6th
edition of this book and we will let you know.
The second essential fact about Internet traffic is that it is highly skewed.
Many properties with which we are familiar are clustered around an average. For
instance, most adults are close to the average height. There are some tall people
and some short people, but few very tall or very short people. For these kinds of
properties, it is possible to design for a range that is not very large but nonetheless
captures the majority of the population.
Internet traffic is not like this. For a long time, it has been known that there
are a small number of Web sites with massive traffic and a vast number of Web
site with much smaller traffic. This feature has become part of the language of
networking. Early papers talked about traffic in terms of packet trains, the idea

---

## Page 127

SEC. 7.5
CONTENT DELIVERY
737
being that express trains with a large number of packets would suddenly travel
down a link (Jain and Routhier, 1986). This was formalized as the notion of self-
similarity, which for our purposes can be thought of as network traffic that exhi-
bits many short and many long gaps even when viewed at different time scales
(Leland et al., 1994). Later work spoke of long traffic flows as elephants and
short traffic flows as mice. The idea is that there are only a few elephants and
many mice, but the elephants matter because they are so big.
Returning to Web content, the same sort of skew is evident. Experience with
video rental stores, public libraries, and other such organizations shows that not
all items are equally popular. Experimentally, when N movies are available, the
fraction of all requests for the kth most popular one is approximately C /k. Here,
C is computed to normalize the sum to 1, namely,
C = 1/(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + . . . + 1/N)
Thus, the most popular movie is seven times as popular as the number seven
movie. This result is known as Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1949). It is named after George
Zipf, a professor of linguistics at Harvard University who noted that the frequency
of a word’s usage in a large body of text is inversely proportional to its rank. For
example, the 40th most common word is used twice as much as the 80th most
common word and three times as much as the 120th most common word.
A Zipf distribution is shown in Fig. 7-64(a). It captures the notion that there
are a small number of popular items and a great many unpopular items. To recog-
nize distributions of this form, it is convenient to plot the data on a log scale on
both axes, as shown in Fig. 7-64(b). The result should be a straight line.

When people looked at the popularity of Web pages, it also turned out to
roughly follow Zipf’s law (Breslau et al., 1999). A Zipf distribution is one ex-
ample in a family of distributions known as power laws. Power laws are evident

in many human phenomena, such as the distribution of city populations and of
wealth. They have the same propensity to describe a few large players and a great
many smaller players, and they too appear as a straight line on a log-log plot. It
was soon discovered that the topology of the Internet could be roughly described
with power laws (Faloutsos et al., 1999). Next, researchers began plotting every
imaginable property of the Internet on a log scale, observing a straight line, and
shouting: ‘‘Power law!’’
However, what matters more than a straight line on a log-log plot is what
these distributions mean for the design and use of networks. Given the many
forms of content that have Zipf or power law distributions, it seems fundamental
that Web sites on the Internet are Zipf-like in popularity. This in turn means that
an average site is not a useful representation. Sites are better described as either
popular or unpopular. Both kinds of sites matter. The popular sites obviously
matter, since a few popular sites may be responsible for most of the traffic on the
Internet. Perhaps surprisingly, the unpopular sites can matter too. This is because
the total amount of traffic directed to the unpopular sites can add up to a large
fraction of the overall traffic. The reason is that there are so many unpopular sites.
The notion that, collectively, many unpopular choices can matter has been popu-
larized by books such as The Long Tail (Anderson, 2008a).
Curves showing decay like that of Fig. 7-64(a) are common, but they are not
all the same. In particular, situations in which the rate of decay is proportional to
how much material is left (such as with unstable radioactive atoms) exhibit
exponential decay, which drops off much faster than Zipf’s Law. The number of
items, say atoms, left after time t is usually expressed as e −t /α, where the constant
α determines how fast the decay is. The difference between exponential decay
and Zipf’s Law is that with exponential decay, it is safe to ignore the end of tail
but with Zipf’s Law the total weight of the tail is significant and cannot be
ignored.
To work effectively in this skewed world, we must be able to build both kinds
of Web sites. Unpopular sites are easy to handle. By using DNS, many different
sites may actually point to the same computer in the Internet that runs all of the
sites. On the other hand, popular sites are difficult to handle. There is no single
computer even remotely powerful enough, and using a single computer would
make the site inaccessible for millions of users if it fails. To handle these sites, we
must build content distribution systems. We will start on that quest next.
7.5.2 Server Farms and Web Proxies
The Web designs that we have seen so far have a single server machine talk-
ing to multiple client machines. To build large Web sites that perform well, we
can speed up processing on either the server side or the client side. On the server
side, more powerful Web servers can be built with a server farm, in which a clus-
ter of computers acts as a single server. On the client side, better performance can

be achieved with better caching techniques. In particular, proxy caches provide a
large shared cache for a group of clients.
We will describe each of these techniques in turn. However, note that neither
technique is sufficient to build the largest Web sites. Those popular sites require
the content distribution methods that we describe in the following sections, which
combine computers at many different locations.
Server Farms
No matter how much bandwidth one machine has, it can only serve so many
Web requests before the load is too great. The solution in this case is to use more
than one computer to make a Web server. This leads to the server farm model of
Fig. 7-65.

Figure 7-65. A server farm.
The difficulty with this seemingly simple model is that the set of computers
that make up the server farm must look like a single logical Web site to clients. If
they do not, we have just set up different Web sites that run in parallel.
There are several possible solutions to make the set of servers appear to be
one Web site. All of the solutions assume that any of the servers can handle a re-
quest from any client. To do this, each server must have a copy of the Web site.
The servers are shown as connected to a common back-end database by a dashed
line for this purpose.
One solution is to use DNS to spread the requests across the servers in the ser-
ver farm. When a DNS request is made for the Web URL, the DNS server returns
a rotating list of the IP addresses of the servers. Each client tries one IP address,
typically the first on the list. The effect is that different clients contact different
servers to access the same Web site, just as intended. The DNS method is at the
heart of CDNs, and we will revisit it later in this section.
The other solutions are based on a front end that sprays incoming requests
over the pool of servers in the server farm. This happens even when the client

---

THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
contacts the server farm using a single destination IP address. The front end is
usually a link-layer switch or an IP router, that is, a device that handles frames or
packets. All of the solutions are based on it (or the servers) peeking at the net-
work, transport, or application layer headers and using them in nonstandard ways.
A Web request and response are carried as a TCP connection. To work correctly,
the front end must distribute all of the packets for a request to the same server.
A simple design is for the front end to broadcast all of the incoming requests
to all of the servers. Each server answers only a fraction of the requests by prior
agreement. For example, 16 servers might look at the source IP address and reply
to the request only if the last 4 bits of the source IP address match their configured
selectors. Other packets are discarded. While this is wasteful of incoming band-
width, often the responses are much longer than the request, so it is not nearly as
inefficient as it sounds.
In a more general design, the front end may inspect the IP, TCP, and HTTP
headers of packets and arbitrarily map them to a server. The mapping is called a
load balancing policy as the goal is to balance the workload across the servers.
The policy may be simple or complex. A simple policy might be to use the servers
one after the other in turn, or round-robin. With this approach, the front end must
remember the mapping for each request so that subsequent packets that are part of
the same request will be sent to the same server. Also, to make the site more reli-
able than a single server, the front end should notice when servers have failed and
stop sending them requests.
Much like NAT, this general design is perilous, or at least fragile, in that we
have just created a device that violates the most basic principle of layered proto-
cols: each layer must use its own header for control purposes and may not inspect
and use information from the payload for any purpose. But people design such
systems anyway and when they break in the future due to changes in higher lay-
ers, they tend to be surprised. The front end in this case is a switch or router, but
it may take action based on transport layer information or higher. Such a box is
called a middlebox because it interposes itself in the middle of a network path in
which it has no business, according to the protocol stack. In this case, the front
end is best considered an internal part of a server farm that terminates all layers
up to the application layer (and hence can use all of the header information for
those layers).
Nonetheless, as with NAT, this design is useful in practice. The reason for
looking at TCP headers is that it is possible to do a better job of load balancing
than with IP information alone. For example, one IP address may represent an en-
tire company and make many requests. It is only by looking at TCP or higher-
layer information that these requests can be mapped to different servers.
The reason for looking at the HTTP headers is somewhat different. Many
Web interactions access and update databases, such as when a customer looks up
her most recent purchase. The server that fields this request will have to query the
back-end database. It is useful to direct subsequent requests from the same user to

---

## Page 131

SEC. 7.5
CONTENT DELIVERY
741
the same server, because that server has already cached information about the
user. The simplest way to cause this to happen is to use Web cookies (or other
information to distinguish the user) and to inspect the HTTP headers to find the
cookies.
As a final note, although we have described this design for Web sites, a server
farm can be built for other kinds of servers as well. An example is servers stream-
ing media over UDP. The only change that is required is for the front end to be
able to load balance these requests (which will have different protocol header
fields than Web requests).
Web Proxies
Web requests and responses are sent using HTTP. In Sec. 7.3, we described
how browsers can cache responses and reuse them to answer future requests. Var-
ious header fields and rules are used by the browser to determine if a cached copy
of a Web page is still fresh. We will not repeat that material here.
Caching improves performance by shortening the response time and reducing
the network load. If the browser can determine that a cached page is fresh by it-
self, the page can be fetched from the cache immediately, with no network traffic
at all. However, even if the browser must ask the server for confirmation that the
page is still fresh, the response time is shortened and the network load is reduced,
especially for large pages, since only a small message needs to be sent.
However, the best the browser can do is to cache all of the Web pages that the
user has previously visited. From our discussion of popularity, you may recall
that as well as a few popular pages that many people visit repeatedly, there are
many, many unpopular pages. In practice, this limits the effectiveness of browser
caching because there are a large number of pages that are visited just once by a
given user. These pages always have to be fetched from the server.
One strategy to make caches more effective is to share the cache among mul-
tiple users. That way, a page already fetched for one user can be returned to an-
other user when that user makes the same request. Without browser caching, both
users would need to fetch the page from the server. Of course, this sharing cannot
be done for encrypted traffic, pages that require authentication, and uncacheable
pages (e.g., current stock prices) that are returned by programs. Dynamic pages
created by programs, especially, are a growing case for which caching is not ef-
fective. Nonetheless, there are plenty of Web pages that are visible to many users
and look the same no matter which user makes the request (e.g., images).
A Web proxy is used to share a cache among users. A proxy is an agent that
acts on behalf of someone else, such as the user. There are many kinds of proxies.
For instance, an ARP proxy replies to ARP requests on behalf of a user who is
elsewhere (and cannot reply for himself). A Web proxy fetches Web requests on
behalf of its users. It normally provides caching of the Web responses, and since
it is shared across users it has a substantially larger cache than a browser.

THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
When a proxy is used, the typical setup is for an organization to operate one
Web proxy for all of its users. The organization might be a company or an ISP.
Both stand to benefit by speeding up Web requests for its users and reducing its
bandwidth needs. While flat pricing, independent of usage, is common for end
users, most companies and ISPs are charged according to the bandwidth that they
use.
This setup is shown in Fig. 7-66. To use the proxy, each browser is configu-
red to make page requests to the proxy instead of to the page’s real server. If the
proxy has the page, it returns the page immediately. If not, it fetches the page
from the server, adds it to the cache for future use, and returns it to the client that
requested it.

Figure 7-66. A proxy cache between Web browsers and Web servers.
As well as sending Web requests to the proxy instead of the real server, cli-
ents perform their own caching using its browser cache. The proxy is only con-
sulted after the browser has tried to satisfy the request from its own cache. That is,
the proxy provides a second level of caching.
Further proxies may be added to provide additional levels of caching. Each
proxy (or browser) makes requests via its upstream proxy. Each upstream proxy
caches for the downstream proxies (or browsers). Thus, it is possible for brow-
sers in a company to use a company proxy, which uses an ISP proxy, which con-
tacts Web servers directly. However, the single level of proxy caching we have
shown in Fig. 7-66 is often sufficient to gain most of the potential benefits, in
practice. The problem again is the long tail of popularity. Studies of Web traffic
have shown that shared caching is especially beneficial until the number of users
reaches about the size of a small company (say, 100 people). As the number of
people grows larger, the benefits of sharing a cache become marginal because of
the unpopular requests that cannot be cached due to lack of storage space (Wol-
man et al., 1999).
Web proxies provide additional benefits that are often a factor in the decision
to deploy them. One benefit is to filter content. The administrator may configure

the proxy to blacklist sites or otherwise filter the requests that it makes. For ex-
ample, many administrators frown on employees watching YouTube videos (or
worse yet, pornography) on company time and set their filters accordingly. An-
other benefit of having proxies is privacy or anonymity, when the proxy shields
the identity of the user from the server.
7.5.3 Content Delivery Networks
Server farms and Web proxies help to build large sites and to improve Web
performance, but they are not sufficient for truly popular Web sites that must
serve content on a global scale. For these sites, a different approach is needed.
CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) turn the idea of traditional Web caching
on its head. Instead, of having clients look for a copy of the requested page in a
nearby cache, it is the provider who places a copy of the page in a set of nodes at
different locations and directs the client to use a nearby node as the server.
An example of the path that data follows when it is distributed by a CDN is
shown in Fig. 7-67. It is a tree. The origin server in the CDN distributes a copy of
the content to other nodes in the CDN, in Sydney, Boston, and Amsterdam, in this
example. This is shown with dashed lines. Clients then fetch pages from the
nearest node in the CDN. This is shown with solid lines. In this way, the clients
in Sydney both fetch the page copy that is stored in Sydney; they do not both fetch
the page from the origin server, which may be in Europe.

Figure 7-67. CDN distribution tree.
Using a tree structure has three virtues. First, the content distribution can be
scaled up to as many clients as needed by using more nodes in the CDN, and more
levels in the tree when the distribution among CDN nodes becomes the
bottleneck. No matter how many clients there are, the tree structure is efficient.
The origin server is not overloaded because it talks to the many clients via the tree

THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
of CDN nodes; it does not have to answer each request for a page by itself. Sec-
ond, each client gets good performance by fetching pages from a nearby server in-
stead of a distant server. This is because the round-trip time for setting up a con-
nection is shorter, TCP slow-start ramps up more quickly because of the shorter
round-trip time, and the shorter network path is less likely to pass through regions
of congestion in the Internet. Finally, the total load that is placed on the network
is also kept at a minimum. If the CDN nodes are well placed, the traffic for a
given page should pass over each part of the network only once. This is important
because someone pays for network bandwidth, eventually.
The idea of using a distribution tree is straightforward. What is less simple is
how to organize the clients to use this tree. For example, proxy servers would
seem to provide a solution. Looking at Fig. 7-67, if each client was configured to
use the Sydney, Boston or Amsterdam CDN node as a caching Web proxy, the
distribution would follow the tree. However, this strategy falls short in practice,
for three reasons. The first reason is that the clients in a given part of the network
probably belong to different organizations, so they are probably using different
Web proxies. Recall that caches are not usually shared across organizations be-
cause of the limited benefit of caching over a large number of clients, and for se-
curity reasons too. Second, there can be multiple CDNs, but each client uses only
a single proxy cache. Which CDN should a client use as its proxy? Finally, per-
haps the most practical issue of all is that Web proxies are configured by clients.
They may or may not be configured to benefit content distribution by a CDN, and
there is little that the CDN can do about it.
Another simple way to support a distribution tree with one level is to use mir-
roring. In this approach, the origin server replicates content over the CDN nodes
as before. The CDN nodes in different network regions are called mirrors. The
Web pages on the origin server contain explicit links to the different mirrors,
usually telling the user their location. This design lets the user manually select a
nearby mirror to use for downloading content. A typical use of mirroring is to
place a large software package on mirrors located in, for example, the East and
West coasts of the U.S., Asia, and Europe. Mirrored sites are generally com-
pletely static, and the choice of sites remains stable for months or years. They are
a tried and tested technique. However, they depend on the user to do the distribu-
tion as the mirrors are really different Web sites, even if they are linked together.
The third approach, which overcomes the difficulties of the previous two ap-
proaches, uses DNS and is called DNS redirection. Suppose that a client wants
to fetch a page with the URL http://www.cdn.com/page.html. To fetch the page,
the browser will use DNS to resolve www.cdn.com to an IP address. This DNS
lookup proceeds in the usual manner. By using the DNS protocol, the browser
learns the IP address of the name server for cdn.com, then contacts the name
server to ask it to resolve www.cdn.com. Now comes the really clever bit. The
name server is run by the CDN. Instead, of returning the same IP address for each
request, it will look at the IP address of the client making the request and return

745
different answers. The answer will be the IP address of the CDN node that is
nearest the client. That is, if a client in Sydney asks the CDN name server to
resolve www.cdn.com, the name server will return the IP address of the Sydney
CDN node, but if a client in Amsterdam makes the same request, the name server
will return the IP address of the Amsterdam CDN node instead.
This strategy is perfectly legal according to the semantics of DNS. We have
previously seen that name servers may return changing lists of IP addresses. After
the name resolution, the Sydney client will fetch the page directly from the Syd-
ney CDN node. Further pages on the same ‘‘server’’ will be fetched directly from
the Sydney CDN node as well because of DNS caching. The overall sequence of
steps is shown in Fig. 7-68.

Figure 7-68. Directing clients to nearby CDN nodes using DNS.
A complex question in the above process is what it means to find the nearest
CDN node, and how to go about it. To define nearest, it is not really geography
that matters. There are at least two factors to consider in mapping a client to a
CDN node. One factor is the network distance. The client should have a short and
high-capacity network path to the CDN node. This situation will produce quick
downloads. CDNs use a map they have previously computed to translate between
the IP address of a client and its network location. The CDN node that is selected
might be the one at the shortest distance as the crow flies, or it might not. What
matters is some combination of the length of the network path and any capacity
limits along it. The second factor is the load that is already being carried by the
CDN node. If the CDN nodes are overloaded, they will deliver slow responses,
just like the overloaded Web server that we sought to avoid in the first place.
Thus, it may be necessary to balance the load across the CDN nodes, mapping
some clients to nodes that are slightly further away but more lightly loaded.
The techniques for using DNS for content distribution were pioneered by
Akamai starting in 1998, when the Web was groaning under the load of its early

---

## Page 136

746
THE APPLICATION LAYER
CHAP. 7
growth. Akamai was the first major CDN and became the industry leader. Proba-
bly even more clever than the idea of using DNS to connect clients to nearby
nodes was the incentive structure of their business. Companies pay Akamai to de-
liver their content to clients, so that they have responsive Web sites that customers
like to use. The CDN nodes must be placed at network locations with good con-
nectivity, which initially meant inside ISP networks. For the ISPs, there is a bene-
fit to having a CDN node in their networks, namely that the CDN node cuts down
the amount of upstream network bandwidth that they need (and must pay for), just
as with proxy caches. In addition, the CDN node improves responsiveness for the
ISP’s customers, which makes the ISP look good in their eyes, giving them a
competitive advantage over ISPs that do not have a CDN node. These benefits (at
no cost to the ISP) makes installing a CDN node a no brainer for the ISP. Thus,
the content provider, the ISP, and the customers all benefit and the CDN makes
money. Since 1998, other companies have gotten into the business, so it is now a
competitive industry with multiple providers.
As this description implies, most companies do not build their own CDN. In-
stead, they use the services of a CDN provider such as Akamai to actually deliver
their content. To let other companies use the service of a CDN, we need to add
one last step to our picture.
After the contract is signed for a CDN to distribute content on behalf of a
Web site owner, the owner gives the CDN the content. This content is pushed to
the CDN nodes. In addition, the owner rewrites any of its Web pages that link to
the content. Instead of linking to the content on their Web site, the pages link to
the content via the CDN. As an example of how this scheme works, consider the
source code for Fluffy Video’s Web page, given in Fig. 7-69(a). After preproc-
essing, it is transformed to Fig. 7-69(b) and placed on Fluffy Video’s server as
www.fluffyvideo.com/index.html.
When a user types in the URL www.fluffyvideo.com to his browser, DNS re-
turns the IP address of Fluffy Video’s own Web site, allowing the main (HTML)
page to be fetched in the normal way. When the user clicks on any of the hyper-
links, the browser asks DNS to look up www.cdn.com. This lookup contacts the
CDN’s DNS server, which returns the IP address of the nearby CDN node. The
browser then sends a regular HTTP request to the CDN node, for example, for
/fluffyvideo/koalas.mpg. The URL identifies the page to return, starting the path
with fluffyvideo so that the CDN node can separate requests for the different com-
panies that it serves. Finally, the video is returned and the user sees cute fluffy
animals.
The strategy behind this split of content hosted by the CDN and entry pages
hosted by the content owner is that it gives the content owner control while letting
the CDN move the bulk of the data. Most entry pages are tiny, being just HTML
text. These pages often link to large files, such as videos and images. It is pre-
cisely these large files that are served by the CDN, even though the use of a CDN
is completely transparent to users. The site looks the same, but performs faster.

There is another advantage for sites using a shared CDN. The future demand
for a Web site can be difficult to predict. Frequently, there are surges in demand
known as flash crowds. Such a surge may happen when the latest product is re-
leased, there is a fashion show or other event, or the company is otherwise in the
news. Even a Web site that was a previously unknown, unvisited backwater can
suddenly become the focus of the Internet if it is newsworthy and linked from
popular sites. Since most sites are not prepared to handle massive increases in
traffic, the result is that many of them crash when traffic surges.
Case in point. Normally the Florida Secretary of State’s Web site is not a busy
place, although you can look up information about Florida corporations, notaries,
and cultural affairs, as well as information about voting and elections there. For
some odd reason, on Nov. 7, 2000 (the date of the U.S. presidential election with
Bush vs. Gore), a whole lot of people were suddenly interested in the election re-
sults page of this site. The site suddenly became one of the busiest Web sites in
the world and naturally crashed as a result. If it had been using a CDN, it would
probably have survived.
By using a CDN, a site has access to a very large content-serving capacity.
The largest CDNs have tens of thousands of servers deployed in countries all over
the world. Since only a small number of sites will be experiencing a flash crowd

at any one time (by definition), those sites may use the CDN’s capacity to handle
the load until the storm passes. That is, the CDN can quickly scale up a site’s
serving capacity.
The preceding discussion above is a simplified description of how Akamai
works. There are many more details that matter in practice. The CDN nodes pic-
tured in our example are normally clusters of machines. DNS redirection is done
with two levels: one to map clients to the approximate network location, and an-
other to spread the load over nodes in that location. Both reliability and perfor-
mance are concerns. To be able to shift a client from one machine in a cluster to
another, DNS replies at the second level are given with short TTLs so that the cli-
ent will repeat the resolution after a short while. Finally, while we have concen-
trated on distributing static objects like images and videos, CDNs can also support
dynamic page creation, streaming media, and more. For more information about
CDNs, see Dilley et al. (2002).
7.5.4 Peer-to-Peer Networks
Not everyone can set up a 1000-node CDN at locations around the world to
distribute their content. (Actually, it is not hard to rent 1000 virtual machines
around the globe because of the well-developed and competitive hosting industry.
However, setting up a CDN only starts with getting the nodes.) Luckily, there is
an alternative for the rest of us that is simple to use and can distribute a tremen-
dous amount of content. It is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) network.
P2P networks burst onto the scene starting in 1999. The first widespread ap-
plication was for mass crime: 50 million Napster users were exchanging copy-
righted songs without the copyright owners’ permission until Napster was shut
down by the courts amid great controversy. Nevertheless, peer-to-peer technolo-
gy has many interesting and legal uses. Other systems continued development,
with such great interest from users that P2P traffic quickly eclipsed Web traffic.
Today, BitTorrent is the most popular P2P protocol. It is used so widely to share
(licensed and public domain) videos, as well as other content, that it accounts for
a large fraction of all Internet traffic. We will look at it in this section.
The basic idea of a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) file-sharing network is that many
computers come together and pool their resources to form a content distribution
system. The computers are often simply home computers. They do not need to be
machines in Internet data centers. The computers are called peers because each
one can alternately act as a client to another peer, fetching its content, and as a
server, providing content to other peers. What makes peer-to-peer systems inter-
esting is that there is no dedicated infrastructure, unlike in a CDN. Everyone par-
ticipates in the task of distributing content, and there is often no central point of
control.
Many people are excited about P2P technology because it is seen as empow-
ering the little guy. The reason is not only that it takes a large company to run a

749
CDN, while anyone with a computer can join a P2P network. It is that P2P net-
works have a formidable capacity to distribute content that can match the largest
of Web sites.
Consider a P2P network made up of N average users, each with broadband
connectivity at 1 Mbps. The aggregate upload capacity of the P2P network, or rate
at which the users can send traffic into the Internet, is N Mbps. The download
capacity, or rate at which the users can receive traffic, is also N Mbps. Each user
can upload and download at the same time, too, because they have a 1-Mbps link
in each direction.
It is not obvious that this should be true, but it turns out that all of the capacity
can be used productively to distribute content, even for the case of sharing a sin-
gle copy of a file with all the other users. To see how this can be so, imagine that
the users are organized into a binary tree, with each non-leaf user sending to two
other users. The tree will carry the single copy of the file to all the other users. To
use the upload bandwidth of as many users as possible at all times (and hence dis-
tribute the large file with low latency), we need to pipeline the network activity of
the users. Imagine that the file is divided into 1000 pieces. Each user can receive
a new piece from somewhere up the tree and send the previously received piece
down the tree at the same time. This way, once the pipeline is started, after a
small number of pieces (equal to the depth of the tree) are sent, all non-leaf users
will be busy uploading the file to other users. Since there are approximately N/2
non-leaf users, the upload bandwidth of this tree is N/2 Mbps. We can repeat this
trick and create another tree that uses the other N/2 Mbps of upload bandwidth by
swapping the roles of leaf and non-leaf nodes. Together, this construction uses all
of the capacity.
This argument means that P2P networks are self-scaling. Their usable upload
capacity grows in tandem with the download demands that can be made by their
users. They are always ‘‘large enough’’ in some sense, without the need for any
dedicated infrastructure. In contrast, the capacity of even a large Web site is fixed
and will either be too large or too small. Consider a site with only 100 clusters,
each capable of 10 Gbps. This enormous capacity does not help when there are a
small number of users. The site cannot get information to N users at a rate faster
than N Mbps because the limit is at the users and not the Web site. And when
there are more than one million 1-Mbps users, the Web site cannot pump out data
fast enough to keep all the users busy downloading. That may seem like a large
number of users, but large BitTorrent networks (e.g., Pirate Bay) claim to have
more than 10,000,000 users. That is more like 10 terabits/sec in terms of our ex-
ample!
You should take these back-of-the-envelope numbers with a grain (or better
yet, a metric ton) of salt because they oversimplify the situation. A significant
challenge for P2P networks is to use bandwidth well when users can come in all
shapes and sizes, and have different download and upload capacities. Neverthe-
less, these numbers do indicate the enormous potential of P2P.

There is another reason that P2P networks are important. CDNs and other
centrally run services put the providers in a position of having a trove of personal
information about many users, from browsing preferences and where people shop
online, to people’s locations and email addresses. This information can be used to
provide better, more personalized service, or it can be used to intrude on people’s
privacy. The latter may happen either intentionally—say as part of a new prod-
uct—or through an accidental disclosure or compromise. With P2P systems, there
can be no single provider that is capable of monitoring the entire system. This
does not mean that P2P systems will necessarily provide privacy, as users are
trusting each other to some extent. It only means that they can provide a different
form of privacy than centrally managed systems. P2P systems are now being
explored for services beyond file sharing (e.g., storage, streaming), and time will
tell whether this advantage is significant.
P2P technology has followed two related paths as it has been developed. On
the more practical side, there are the systems that are used every day. The most
well known of these systems are based on the BitTorrent protocol. On the more
academic side, there has been intense interest in DHT (Distributed Hash Table)
algorithms that let P2P systems perform well as a whole, yet rely on no cent-
ralized components at all. We will look at both of these technologies.
BitTorrent
The BitTorrent protocol was developed by Brahm Cohen in 2001 to let a set
of peers share files quickly and easily. There are dozens of freely available cli-
ents that speak this protocol, just as there are many browsers that speak the HTTP
protocol to Web servers. The protocol is available as an open standard at
www.bittorrent.org.
In a typical peer-to-peer system, like that formed with BitTorrent, the users
each have some information that may be of interest to other users. This infor-
mation may be free software, music, videos, photographs, and so on. There are
three problems that need to be solved to share content in this setting:
1. How does a peer find other peers that have the content it wants to
download?
2. How is content replicated by peers to provide high-speed downloads
for everyone?
3. How do peers encourage each other to upload content to others as
well as download content for themselves?
The first problem exists because not all peers will have all of the content, at
least initially. The approach taken in BitTorrent is for every content provider to
create a content description called a torrent. The torrent is much smaller than the

content, and is used by a peer to verify the integrity of the data that it downloads
from other peers. Other users who want to download the content must first obtain
the torrent, say, by finding it on a Web page advertising the content.
The torrent is just a file in a specified format that contains two key kinds of
information. One kind is the name of a tracker, which is a server that leads peers
to the content of the torrent. The other kind of information is a list of equal-sized
pieces, or chunks, that make up the content. Different chunk sizes can be used for
different torrents, typically 64 KB to 512 KB. The torrent file contains the name
of each chunk, given as a 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the chunk. We will cover
cryptographic hashes such as SHA-1 in Chap. 8. For now, you can think of a hash
as a longer and more secure checksum. Given the size of chunks and hashes, the
torrent file is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the content, so it can
be transferred quickly.
To download the content described in a torrent, a peer first contacts the
tracker for the torrent. The tracker is a server that maintains a list of all the other
peers that are actively downloading and uploading the content. This set of peers
is called a swarm. The members of the swarm contact the tracker regularly to
report that they are still active, as well as when they leave the swarm. When a
new peer contacts the tracker to join the swarm, the tracker tells it about other
peers in the swarm. Getting the torrent and contacting the tracker are the first two
steps for downloading content, as shown in Fig. 7-70.

The second problem is how to share content in a way that gives rapid down-
loads. When a swarm is first formed, some peers must have all of the chunks that
make up the content. These peers are called seeders. Other peers that join the
swarm will have no chunks; they are the peers that are downloading the content.
While a peer participates in a swarm, it simultaneously downloads chunks that
it is missing from other peers, and uploads chunks that it has to other peers who

need them. This trading is shown as the last step of content distribution in Fig. 7-
70. Over time, the peer gathers more chunks until it has downloaded all of the
content. The peer can leave the swarm (and return) at any time. Normally a peer
will stay for a short period after finishes its own download. With peers coming
and going, the rate of churn in a swarm can be quite high.
For the above method to work well, each chunk should be available at many
peers. If everyone were to get the chunks in the same order, it is likely that many
peers would depend on the seeders for the next chunk. This would create a
bottleneck. Instead, peers exchange lists of the chunks they have with each other.
Then they select rare chunks that are hard to find to download. The idea is that
downloading a rare chunk will make a copy of it, which will make the chunk easi-
er for other peers to find and download. If all peers do this, after a short while all
chunks will be widely available.
The third problem is perhaps the most interesting. CDN nodes are set up
exclusively to provide content to users. P2P nodes are not. They are users’ com-
puters, and the users may be more interested in getting a movie than helping other
users with their downloads. Nodes that take resources from a system without con-
tributing in kind are called free-riders or leechers. If there are too many of them,
the system will not function well. Earlier P2P systems were known to host them
(Saroiu et al., 2003) so BitTorrent sought to minimize them.
The approach taken in BitTorrent clients is to reward peers who show good
upload behavior. Each peer randomly samples the other peers, retrieving chunks
from them while it uploads chunks to them. The peer continues to trade chunks
with only a small number of peers that provide the highest download performance,
while also randomly trying other peers to find good partners. Randomly trying
peers also allows newcomers to obtain initial chunks that they can trade with other
peers. The peers with which a node is currently exchanging chunks are said to be
unchoked.
Over time, this algorithm is intended to match peers with comparable upload
and download rates with each other. The more a peer is contributing to the other
peers, the more it can expect in return. Using a set of peers also helps to saturate a
peer’s download bandwidth for high performance. Conversely, if a peer is not
uploading chunks to other peers, or is doing so very slowly, it will be cut off, or
choked, sooner or later. This strategy discourages antisocial behavior in which
peers free-ride on the swarm.
The choking algorithm is sometimes described as implementing the tit-for-tat
strategy that encourages cooperation in repeated interactions. However, it does
not prevent clients from gaming the system in any strong sense (Piatek et al.,
2007). Nonetheless, attention to the issue and mechanisms that make it more dif-
ficult for casual users to free-ride have likely contributed to the success of Bit-
Torrent.
As you can see from our discussion, BitTorrent comes with a rich vocabulary.
There are torrents, swarms, leechers, seeders, and trackers, as well as snubbing,

Torrent (Cohen, 2003) and look on the Web starting with www.bittorrent.org.
DHTs—Distributed Hash Tables
The emergence of P2P file sharing networks around 2000 sparked much inter-
est in the research community. The essence of P2P systems is that they avoid the
centrally managed structures of CDNs and other systems. This can be a significant
advantage. Centrally managed components become a bottleneck as the system
grows very large and are a single point of failure. Central components can also be
used as a point of control (e.g., to shut off the P2P network). However, the early
P2P systems were only partly decentralized, or, if they were fully decentralized,
they were inefficient.
The traditional form of BitTorrent that we just described uses peer-to-peer
transfers and a centralized tracker for each swarm. It is the tracker that turns out
to be the hard part to decentralize in a peer-to-peer system. The key problem is
how to find out which peers have specific content that is being sought. For ex-
ample, each user might have one or more data items such as songs, photographs,
programs, files, and so on that other users might want to read. How do the other
users find them? Making one index of who has what is simple, but it is cent-
ralized. Having every peer keep its own index does not help. True, it is distrib-
uted. However, it requires so much work to keep the indexes of all peers up to
date (as content is moved about the system) that it is not worth the effort.
The question tackled by the research community was whether it was possible
to build P2P indexes that were entirely distributed but performed well. By per-
form well, we mean three things. First, each node keeps only a small amount of
information about other nodes. This property means that it will not be expensive
to keep the index up to date. Second, each node can look up entries in the index
quickly. Otherwise, it is not a very useful index. Third, each node can use the
index at the same time, even as other nodes come and go. This property means
the performance of the index grows with the number of nodes.
The answer is to the question was: ‘‘Yes.’’ Four different solutions were in-
vented in 2001. They are Chord (Stoica et al., 2001), CAN (Ratnasamy et al.,
2001), Pastry (Rowstron and Druschel, 2001), and Tapestry (Zhao et al., 2004).
Other solutions were invented soon afterwards, including Kademlia, which is used
in practice (Maymounkov and Mazieres, 2002). The solutions are known as DHTs
(Distributed Hash Tables) because the basic functionality of an index is to map
a key to a value. This is like a hash table, and the solutions are distributed ver-
sions, of course.
DHTs do their work by imposing a regular structure on the communication
between the nodes, as we will see. This behavior is quite different than that of
traditional P2P networks that use whatever connections peers happen to make.

For this reason, DHTs are called structured P2P networks. Traditional P2P pro-
tocols build unstructured P2P networks.
The DHT solution that we will describe is Chord. As a scenario, consider
how to replace the centralized tracker traditionally used in BitTorrent with a
fully-distributed tracker.
Chord can be used to solve this problem.
In this
scenario, the overall index is a listing of all of the swarms that a computer may
join to download content. The key used to look up the index is the torrent descrip-
tion of the content. It uniquely identifies a swarm from which content can be
downloaded as the hashes of all the content chunks. The value stored in the index
for each key is the list of peers that comprise the swarm. These peers are the com-
puters to contact to download the content. A person wanting to download content
such as a movie has only the torrent description. The question the DHT must
answer is how, lacking a central database, does a person find out which peers (out
of the millions of BitTorrent nodes) to download the movie from?
A Chord DHT consists of n participating nodes. They are nodes running Bit-
Torrent in our scenario. Each node has an IP address by which it may be con-
tacted. The overall index is spread across the nodes. This implies that each node
stores bits and pieces of the index for use by other nodes. The key part of Chord
is that it navigates the index using identifiers in a virtual space, not the IP ad-
dresses of nodes or the names of content like movies. Conceptually, the identi-
fiers are simply m-bit numbers that can be arranged in ascending order into a ring.
To turn a node address into an identifier, it is mapped to an m-bit number
using a hash function, hash. Chord uses SHA-1 for hash. This is the same hash
that we mentioned when describing BitTorrent. We will look at it when we dis-
cuss cryptography in Chap. 8. For now, suffice it to say that it is just a function
that takes a variable-length byte string as an argument and produces a highly ran-
dom 160-bit number. Thus, we can use it to convert any IP address to a 160-bit
number called the node identifier.
In Fig. 7-71(a), we show the node identifier circle for m = 5. (Just ignore the
arcs in the middle for the moment.) Some of the identifiers correspond to nodes,
but most do not. In this example, the nodes with identifiers 1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 20, and
27 correspond to actual nodes and are shaded in the figure; the rest do not exist.
Let us now define the function successor(k) as the node identifier of the first
actual node following k around the circle, clockwise.
For example, succes-
sor (6) = 7, successor (8) = 12, and successor (22) = 27.
A key is also produced by hashing a content name with hash (i.e., SHA-1) to
generate a 160-bit number. In our scenario, the content name is the torrent. Thus,
in order to convert torrent (the torrent description file) to its key, we compute
key = hash(torrent). This computation is just a local procedure call to hash.
To start a new a swarm, a node needs to insert a new key-value pair consisting
of (torrent, my-IP-address) into the index. To accomplish this, the node asks
successor(hash(torrent)) to store my-IP-address. In this way, the index is distrib-
uted over the nodes at random. For fault tolerance, p different hash functions

could be used to store the data at p nodes, but we will not consider the subject of
fault tolerance further here.
Some time after the DHT is constructed, another node wants to find a torrent
so that it can join the swarm and download content. A node looks up torrent by
first hashing it to get key, and second using successor (key) to find the IP address
of the node storing the corresponding value. The value is the list of peers in the
swarm; the node can add its IP address to the list and contact the other peers to
download content with the BitTorrent protocol.
The first step is easy; the second one is not easy. To make it possible to find
the IP address of the node corresponding to a certain key, each node is required to

maintain certain administrative data structures. One of these is the IP address of
its successor node along the node identifier circle. For example, in Fig. 7-71,
node 4’s successor is 7 and node 7’s successor is 12.
Lookup can now proceed as follows. The requesting node sends a packet to
its successor containing its IP address and the key it is looking for. The packet is
propagated around the ring until it locates the successor to the node identifier
being sought. That node checks to see if it has any information matching the key,
and if so, returns it directly to the requesting node, whose IP address it has.
However, linearly searching all the nodes is very inefficient in a large peer-
to-peer system since the mean number of nodes required per search is n/2. To
greatly speed up the search, each node also maintains what Chord calls a finger
table. The finger table has m entries, indexed by 0 through m −1, each one point-
ing to a different actual node. Each of the entries has two fields: start and the IP
address of successor(start), as shown for three example nodes in Fig. 7-71(b).
The values of the fields for entry i at a node with identifier k are:
start = k + 2i (modulo 2m)
IP address of successor(start [i ])
Note that each node stores the IP addresses of a relatively small number of nodes
and that most of these are fairly close by in terms of node identifier.
Using the finger table, the lookup of key at node k proceeds as follows. If key
falls between k and successor (k), the node holding information about key is
successor (k) and the search terminates. Otherwise, the finger table is searched to
find the entry whose start field is the closest predecessor of key. A request is then
sent directly to the IP address in that finger table entry to ask it to continue the
search. Since it is closer to key but still below it, chances are good that it will be
able to return the answer with only a small number of additional queries. In fact,
since every lookup halves the remaining distance to the target, it can be shown
that the average number of lookups is log2n.
As a first example, consider looking up key = 3 at node 1. Since node 1
knows that 3 lies between it and its successor, 4, the desired node is 4 and the
search terminates, returning node 4’s IP address.
As a second example, consider looking up key = 16 at node 1. Since 16 does
not lie between 1 and 4, the finger table is consulted. The closest predecessor to
16 is 9, so the request is forwarded to the IP address of 9’s entry, namely, that of
node 12. Node 12 also does not know the answer itself, so it looks for the node
most closely preceding 16 and finds 14, which yields the IP address of node 15.
A query is then sent there. Node 15 observes that 16 lies between it and its suc-
cessor (20), so it returns the IP address of 20 to the caller, which works its way
back to node 1.
Since nodes join and leave all the time, Chord needs a way to handle these op-
erations. We assume that when the system began operation it was small enough
that the nodes could just exchange information directly to build the first circle and

757
finger tables. After that, an automated procedure is needed. When a new node, r,
wants to join, it must contact some existing node and ask it to look up the IP
address of successor (r) for it. Next, the new node then asks successor (r) for its
predecessor. The new node then asks both of these to insert r in between them in
the circle. For example, if 24 in Fig. 7-71 wants to join, it asks any node to look
up successor (24), which is 27. Then it asks 27 for its predecessor (20). After it
tells both of those about its existence, 20 uses 24 as its successor and 27 uses 24
as its predecessor. In addition, node 27 hands over those keys in the range 21–24,
which now belong to 24. At this point, 24 is fully inserted.
However, many finger tables are now wrong. To correct them, every node
runs a background process that periodically recomputes each finger by calling
successor. When one of these queries hits a new node, the corresponding finger
entry is updated.
When a node leaves gracefully, it hands its keys over to its successor and
informs its predecessor of its departure so the predecessor can link to the depart-
ing node’s successor. When a node crashes, a problem arises because its prede-
cessor no longer has a valid successor. To alleviate this problem, each node keeps
track not only of its direct successor but also its s direct successors, to allow it to
skip over up to s −1 consecutive failed nodes and reconnect the circle if disaster
strikes.
There has been a tremendous amount of research on DHTs since they were in-
vented. To give you an idea of just how much research, let us pose a question:
what is the most-cited networking paper of all time? You will find it difficult to
come up with a paper that is cited more than the seminal Chord paper (Stoica et
al., 2001). Despite this veritable mountain of research, applications of DHTs are
only slowly beginning to emerge. Some BitTorrent clients use DHTs to provide a
fully distributed tracker of the kind that we described. Large commercial cloud
services such as Amazon’s Dynamo also incorporate DHT techniques (DeCandia
et al., 2007).
7.6 SUMMARY
Naming in the ARPANET started out in a very simple way: an ASCII text file
listed the names of all the hosts and their corresponding IP addresses. Every night
all the machines downloaded this file. But when the ARPANET morphed into the
Internet and exploded in size, a far more sophisticated and dynamic naming
scheme was required. The one used now is a hierarchical scheme called the Do-
main Name System. It organizes all the machines on the Internet into a set of
trees. At the top level are the well-known generic domains, including com and
edu, as well as about 200 country domains. DNS is implemented as a distributed
database with servers all over the world. By querying a DNS server, a process

can map an Internet domain name onto the IP address used to communicate with a
computer for that domain.
Email is the original killer app of the Internet. It is still widely used by every-
one from small children to grandparents. Most email systems in the world use the
mail system now defined in RFCs 5321 and 5322. Messages have simple ASCII
headers, and many kinds of content can be sent using MIME. Mail is submitted to
message transfer agents for delivery and retrieved from them for presentation by a
variety of user agents, including Web applications. Submitted mail is delivered
using SMTP, which works by making a TCP connection from the sending mes-
sage transfer agent to the receiving one.
The Web is the application that most people think of as being the Internet.
Originally, it was a system for seamlessly linking hypertext pages (written in
HTML) across machines. The pages are downloaded by making a TCP con-
nection from the browser to a server and using HTTP. Nowadays, much of the
content on the Web is produced dynamically, either at the server (e.g., with PHP)
or in the browser (e.g., with JavaScript). When combined with back-end data-
bases, dynamic server pages allow Web applications such as e-commerce and
search. Dynamic browser pages are evolving into full-featured applications, such
as email, that run inside the browser and use the Web protocols to communicate
with remote servers.
Caching and persistent connections are widely used to enhance Web per-
formance. Using the Web on mobile devices can be challenging, despite the
growth in the bandwidth and processing power of mobiles. Web sites often send
tailored versions of pages with smaller images and less complex navigation to de-
vices with small displays.
The Web protocols are increasingly being used for machine-to-machine com-
munication. XML is preferred to HTML as a description of content that is easy for
machines to process. SOAP is an RPC mechanism that sends XML messages
using HTTP.
Digital audio and video have been key drivers for the Internet since 2000. The
majority of Internet traffic today is video. Much of it is streamed from Web sites
over a mix of protocols (including RTP/UDP and RTP/HTTP/TCP). Live media is
streamed to many consumers. It includes Internet radio and TV stations that
broadcast all manner of events. Audio and video are also used for real-time con-
ferencing. Many calls use voice over IP, rather than the traditional telephone net-
work, and include videoconferencing.
There are a small number of tremendously popular Web sites, as well as a
very large number of less popular ones. To serve the popular sites, content distrib-
ution networks have been deployed. CDNs use DNS to direct clients to a nearby
server; the servers are placed in data centers all around the world. Alternatively,
P2P networks let a collection of machines share content such as movies among
themselves. They provide a content distribution capacity that scales with the num-
ber of machines in the P2P network and which can rival the largest of sites.

1. Many business computers have three distinct and worldwide unique identifiers. What
are they?
2. In Fig. 7-4, there is no period after laserjet. Why not?
3. Consider a situation in which a cyberterrorist makes all the DNS servers in the world
crash simultaneously. How does this change one’s ability to use the Internet?
4. DNS uses UDP instead of TCP. If a DNS packet is lost, there is no automatic recov-
ery. Does this cause a problem, and if so, how is it solved?
5. John wants to have an original domain name and uses a randomized program to gener-
ate a secondary domain name for him. He wants to register this domain name in the
com generic domain. The domain name that was generated is 253 characters long.
Will the com registrar allow this domain name to be registered?
6. Can a machine with a single DNS name have multiple IP addresses? How could this
occur?
7. The number of companies with a Web site has grown explosively in recent years. As
a result, thousands of companies are registered in the com domain, causing a heavy
load on the top-level server for this domain. Suggest a way to alleviate this problem
without changing the naming scheme (i.e., without introducing new top-level domain
names). It is permitted that your solution requires changes to the client code.
8. Some email systems support a Content Return: header field. It specifies whether the
body of a message is to be returned in the event of nondelivery. Does this field belong
to the envelope or to the header?
9. Electronic mail systems need directories so people’s email addresses can be looked
up. To build such directories, names should be broken up into standard components
(e.g., first name, last name) to make searching possible. Discuss some problems that
must be solved for a worldwide standard to be acceptable.
10. A large law firm, which has many employees, provides a single email address for each
employee. Each employee’s email address is <login>@lawfirm.com. However, the
firm did not explicitly define the format of the login. Thus, some employees use their
first names as their login names, some use their last names, some use their initials, etc.
The firm now wishes to make a fixed format, for example:
firstname.lastname@lawfirm.com,
that can be used for the email addresses of all its employees. How can this be done
without rocking the boat too much?
11. A binary file is 4560 bytes long. How long will it be if encoded using base64 en-
coding, with a CR+LF pair inserted after every 110 bytes sent and at the end?

activated a vacation agent on their personal account. Because John forwarded his
email, he did not set up a vacation daemon on his work machine. What happens when
an email is received at John’s work email address?
15. In any standard, such as RFC 5322, a precise grammar of what is allowed is needed so
that different implementations can interwork. Even simple items have to be defined
carefully. The SMTP headers allow white space between the tokens. Give two plausi-
ble alternative definitions of white space between tokens.
16. Is the vacation agent part of the user agent or the message transfer agent? Of course,
it is set up using the user agent, but does the user agent actually send the replies? Ex-
plain your answer.
17. In a simple version of the Chord algorithm for peer-to-peer lookup, searches do not
use the finger table. Instead, they are linear around the circle, in either direction. Can
a node accurately predict which direction it should search in? Discuss your answer.
18. IMAP allows users to fetch and download email from a remote mailbox. Does this
mean that the internal format of mailboxes has to be standardized so any IMAP pro-
gram on the client side can read the mailbox on any mail server? Discuss your
answer.
19. Consider the Chord circle of Fig. 7-71. Suppose that node 18 suddenly goes online.
Which of the finger tables shown in the figure are affected? how?
20. Does Webmail use POP3, IMAP, or neither? If one of these, why was that one cho-
sen? If neither, which one is it closer to in spirit?
21. When Web pages are sent out, they are prefixed by MIME headers. Why?
22. Is it possible that when a user clicks on a link with Firefox, a particular helper is start-
ed, but clicking on the same link in Internet Explorer causes a completely different
helper to be started, even though the MIME type returned in both cases is identical?
Explain your answer.
23. Although it was not mentioned in the text, an alternative form for a URL is to use the
IP address instead of its DNS name. Use this information to explain why a DNS name
cannot end with a digit.
24. Imagine that someone in the math department at Stanford has just written a new docu-
ment including a proof that he wants to distribute by FTP for his colleagues to review.
He puts the program in the FTP directory ftp/pub/forReview/newProof.pdf. What is
the URL for this program likely to be?
25. In Fig. 7-22, www.aportal.com keeps track of user preferences in a cookie. A disad-
vantage of this scheme is that cookies are limited to 4 KB, so if the preferences are

extensive, for example, many stocks, sports teams, types of news stories, weather for
multiple cities, specials in numerous product categories, and more, the 4-KB limit may
be reached. Design an alternative way to keep track of preferences that does not have
this problem.
26. Sloth Bank wants to make online banking easy for its lazy customers, so after a custo-
mer signs up and is authenticated by a password, the bank returns a cookie containing
a customer ID number. In this way, the customer does not have to identify himself or
type a password on future visits to the online bank. What do you think of this idea?
Will it work? Is it a good idea?
27. (a) Consider the following HTML tag:
<h1 title=‘‘this is the header’’> HEADER 1 </h1>
Under what conditions does the browser use the TITLE attribute, and how?
(b) How does the TITLE attribute differ from the ALT attribute?
28. How do you make an image clickable in HTML? Give an example.
29. Write an HTML page that includes a link to the email address username@Do-
mainName.com. What happens when a user clicks this link?
30. Write an XML page for a university registrar listing multiple students, each having a
name, an address, and a GPA.
31. For each of the following applications, tell whether it would be (1) possible and (2)
better to use a PHP script or JavaScript, and why:
(a) Displaying a calendar for any requested month since September 1752.
(b) Displaying the schedule of flights from Amsterdam to New York.
(c) Graphing a polynomial from user-supplied coefficients.
32. Write a program in JavaScript that accepts an integer greater than 2 and tells whether
it is a prime number. Note that JavaScript has if and while statements with the same
syntax as C and Java. The modulo operator is %. If you need the square root of x, use
Math.sqrt (x).
33. An HTML page is as follows:
<html> <body>
<a href="www.info-source.com/welcome.html"> Click here for info </a>
</body> </html>
If the user clicks on the hyperlink, a TCP connection is opened and a series of lines is
sent to the server. List all the lines sent.
34. The If-Modified-Since header can be used to check whether a cached page is still
valid. Requests can be made for pages containing images, sound, video, and so on, as
well as HTML. Do you think the effectiveness of this technique is better or worse for
JPEG images as compared to HTML? Think carefully about what ‘‘effectiveness’’
means and explain your answer.
35. On the day of a major sporting event, such as the championship game in some popular
sport, many people go to the official Web site. Is this a flash crowd in the same sense
as the 2000 Florida presidential election? Why or why not?

36. Does it make sense for a single ISP to function as a CDN? If so, how would that
work? If not, what is wrong with the idea?
37. Assume that compression is not used for audio CDs. How many MB of data must the
compact disc contain in order to be able to play two hours of music?
38. In Fig. 7-42(c), quantization noise occurs due to the use of 4-bit samples to represent
nine signal values. The first sample, at 0, is exact, but the next few are not. What is
the percent error for the samples at 1/32, 2/32, and 3/32 of the period?
39. Could a psychoacoustic model be used to reduce the bandwidth needed for Internet te-
lephony? If so, what conditions, if any, would have to be met to make it work? If not,
why not?
40. An audio streaming server has a one-way ‘‘distance’’ of 100 msec to a media player.
It outputs at 1 Mbps. If the media player has a 2-MB buffer, what can you say about
the position of the low-water mark and the high-water mark?
41. Does voice over IP have the same problems with firewalls that streaming audio does?
Discuss your answer.
42. What is the bit rate for transmitting uncompressed 1200 × 800 pixel color frames with
16 bits/pixel at 50 frames/sec?
43. Can a 1-bit error in an MPEG frame affect more than the frame in which the error oc-
curs? Explain your answer.
44. Consider a 50,000-customer video server, where each customer watches three movies
per month. Two-thirds of the movies are served at 9 P.M. How many movies does the
server have to transmit at once during this time period? If each movie requires 6
Mbps, how many OC-12 connections does the server need to the network?
45. Suppose that Zipf’s law holds for accesses to a 10,000-movie video server. If the ser-
ver holds the most popular 1000 movies in memory and the remaining 9000 on disk,
give an expression for the fraction of all references that will be to memory. Write a
little program to evaluate this expression numerically.
46. Some cybersquatters have registered domain names that are misspellings of common
corporate sites, for example, www.microsfot.com. Make a list of at least five such do-
mains.
47. Numerous people have registered DNS names that consist of www.word.com, where
word is a common word. For each of the following categories, list five such Web sites
and briefly summarize what it is (e.g., www.stomach.com belongs to a gastroenterolo-
gist on Long Island). Here is the list of categories: animals, foods, household objects,
and body parts. For the last category, please stick to body parts above the waist.
48. Rewrite the server of Fig. 6-6 as a true Web server using the GET command for HTTP
1.1. It should also accept the Host message. The server should maintain a cache of
files recently fetched from the disk and serve requests from the cache when possible.
