NETWORK SECURITY
For the first few decades of their existence, computer networks were primarily
used by university researchers for sending email and by corporate employees for
sharing printers. Under these conditions, security did not get a lot of attention.
But now, as millions of ordinary citizens are using networks for banking, shop-
ping, and filing their tax returns, and weakness after weakness has been found,
network security has become a problem of massive proportions. In this chapter,
we will study network security from several angles, point out numerous pitfalls,
and discuss many algorithms and protocols for making networks more secure.
Security is a broad topic and covers a multitude of sins. In its simplest form,
it is concerned with making sure that nosy people cannot read, or worse yet,
secretly modify messages intended for other recipients. It is concerned with peo-
ple trying to access remote services that they are not authorized to use. It also
deals with ways to tell whether that message purportedly from the IRS ‘‘Pay by
Friday, or else’’ is really from the IRS and not from the Mafia. Security also
deals with the problems of legitimate messages being captured and replayed, and
with people later trying to deny that they sent certain messages.
Most security problems are intentionally caused by malicious people trying to
gain some benefit, get attention, or harm someone. A few of the most common
perpetrators are listed in Fig. 8-1. It should be clear from this list that making a
network secure involves a lot more than just keeping it free of programming er-
rors. It involves outsmarting often intelligent, dedicated, and sometimes well-
funded adversaries. It should also be clear that measures that will thwart casual

attackers will have little impact on the serious ones. Police records show that the
most damaging attacks are not perpetrated by outsiders tapping a phone line but
by insiders bearing a grudge. Security systems should be designed accordingly.

Figure 8-1. Some people who may cause security problems, and why.
Network security problems can be divided roughly into four closely
intertwined areas: secrecy, authentication, nonrepudiation, and integrity control.
Secrecy, also called confidentiality, has to do with keeping information out of the
grubby little hands of unauthorized users. This is what usually comes to mind
when people think about network security. Authentication deals with determining
whom you are talking to before revealing sensitive information or entering into a
business deal. Nonrepudiation deals with signatures: how do you prove that your
customer really placed an electronic order for ten million left-handed doohickeys
at 89 cents each when he later claims the price was 69 cents? Or maybe he claims
he never placed any order. Finally, integrity control has to do with how you can
be sure that a message you received was really the one sent and not something
that a malicious adversary modified in transit or concocted.
All these issues (secrecy, authentication, nonrepudiation, and integrity con-
trol) occur in traditional systems, too, but with some significant differences. In-
tegrity and secrecy are achieved by using registered mail and locking documents
up. Robbing the mail train is harder now than it was in Jesse James’ day.
Also, people can usually tell the difference between an original paper docu-
ment and a photocopy, and it often matters to them. As a test, make a photocopy
of a valid check. Try cashing the original check at your bank on Monday. Now
try cashing the photocopy of the check on Tuesday. Observe the difference in the
bank’s behavior. With electronic checks, the original and the copy are indistin-
guishable. It may take a while for banks to learn how to handle this.
People authenticate other people by various means, including recognizing
their faces, voices, and handwriting. Proof of signing is handled by signatures on
letterhead paper, raised seals, and so on. Tampering can usually be detected by

handwriting, ink, and paper experts. None of these options are available electron-
ically. Clearly, other solutions are needed.
Before getting into the solutions themselves, it is worth spending a few
moments considering where in the protocol stack network security belongs. There
is probably no one single place. Every layer has something to contribute. In the
physical layer, wiretapping can be foiled by enclosing transmission lines (or better
yet, optical fibers) in sealed tubes containing an inert gas at high pressure. Any
attempt to drill into a tube will release some gas, reducing the pressure and trig-
gering an alarm. Some military systems use this technique.
In the data link layer, packets on a point-to-point line can be encrypted as they
leave one machine and decrypted as they enter another. All the details can be
handled in the data link layer, with higher layers oblivious to what is going on.
This solution breaks down when packets have to traverse multiple routers, howev-
er, because packets have to be decrypted at each router, leaving them vulnerable
to attacks from within the router. Also, it does not allow some sessions to be pro-
tected (e.g., those involving online purchases by credit card) and others not.
Nevertheless, link encryption, as this method is called, can be added to any net-
work easily and is often useful.
In the network layer, firewalls can be installed to keep good packets and bad
packets out. IP security also functions in this layer.
In the transport layer, entire connections can be encrypted end to end, that is,
process to process. For maximum security, end-to-end security is required.
Finally, issues such as user authentication and nonrepudiation can only be
handled in the application layer.
Since security does not fit neatly into any layer, it does not fit into any chapter
of this book. For this reason, it rates its own chapter.
While this chapter is long, technical, and essential, it is also quasi-irrelevant
for the moment. It is well documented that most security failures at banks, for ex-
ample, are due to lax security procedures and incompetent employees, numerous
implementation bugs that enable remote break-ins by unauthorized users, and so-
called social engineering attacks, where customers are tricked into revealing their
account details. All of these security problems are more prevalent than clever
criminals tapping phone lines and then decoding encrypted messages. If a person
can walk into a random branch of a bank with an ATM slip he found on the street
claiming to have forgotten his PIN and get a new one on the spot (in the name of
good customer relations), all the cryptography in the world will not prevent abuse.
In this respect, Ross Anderson’s (2008a) book is a real eye-opener, as it docu-
ments hundreds of examples of security failures in numerous industries, nearly all
of them due to what might politely be called sloppy business practices or inatten-
tion to security. Nevertheless, the technical foundation on which e-commerce is
built when all of these other factors are done well is cryptography.
Except for physical layer security, nearly all network security is based on
cryptographic principles. For this reason, we will begin our study of security by

examining cryptography in some detail. In Sec. 8.1, we will look at some of the
basic principles. In Sec. 8-2 through Sec. 8-5, we will examine some of the fun-
damental algorithms and data structures used in cryptography. Then we will ex-
amine in detail how these concepts can be used to achieve security in networks.
We will conclude with some brief thoughts about technology and society.
Before starting, one last thought is in order: what is not covered. We have
tried to focus on networking issues, rather than operating system and application
issues, although the line is often hard to draw. For example, there is nothing here
about user authentication using biometrics, password security, buffer overflow at-
tacks, Trojan horses, login spoofing, code injection such as cross-site scripting, vi-
ruses, worms, and the like. All of these topics are covered at length in Chap. 9 of
Modern Operating Systems (Tanenbaum, 2007). The interested reader is referred
to that book for the systems aspects of security. Now let us begin our journey.
8.1 CRYPTOGRAPHY
Cryptography comes from the Greek words for ‘‘secret writing.’’ It has a
long and colorful history going back thousands of years. In this section, we will
just sketch some of the highlights, as background information for what follows.
For a complete history of cryptography, Kahn’s (1995) book is recommended
reading. For a comprehensive treatment of modern security and cryptographic al-
gorithms, protocols, and applications, and related material, see Kaufman et al.
(2002). For a more mathematical approach, see Stinson (2002).
For a less
mathematical approach, see Burnett and Paine (2001).
Professionals make a distinction between ciphers and codes. A cipher is a
character-for-character or bit-for-bit transformation, without regard to the linguis-
tic structure of the message. In contrast, a code replaces one word with another
word or symbol. Codes are not used any more, although they have a glorious his-
tory. The most successful code ever devised was used by the U.S. armed forces
during World War II in the Pacific. They simply had Navajo Indians talking to
each other using specific Navajo words for military terms, for example chay-da-
gahi-nail-tsaidi (literally: tortoise killer) for antitank weapon. The Navajo lan-
guage is highly tonal, exceedingly complex, and has no written form. And not a
single person in Japan knew anything about it.
In September 1945, the San Diego Union described the code by saying ‘‘For
three years, wherever the Marines landed, the Japanese got an earful of strange
gurgling noises interspersed with other sounds resembling the call of a Tibetan
monk and the sound of a hot water bottle being emptied.’’ The Japanese never
broke the code and many Navajo code talkers were awarded high military honors
for extraordinary service and bravery. The fact that the U.S. broke the Japanese
code but the Japanese never broke the Navajo code played a crucial role in the
American victories in the Pacific.

8.1.1 Introduction to Cryptography
Historically, four groups of people have used and contributed to the art of
cryptography: the military, the diplomatic corps, diarists, and lovers. Of these, the
military has had the most important role and has shaped the field over the centu-
ries. Within military organizations, the messages to be encrypted have tradition-
ally been given to poorly paid, low-level code clerks for encryption and transmis-
sion. The sheer volume of messages prevented this work from being done by a
few elite specialists.
Until the advent of computers, one of the main constraints on cryptography
had been the ability of the code clerk to perform the necessary transformations,
often on a battlefield with little equipment. An additional constraint has been the
difficulty in switching over quickly from one cryptographic method to another
one, since this entails retraining a large number of people. However, the danger
of a code clerk being captured by the enemy has made it essential to be able to
change the cryptographic method instantly if need be. These conflicting re-
quirements have given rise to the model of Fig. 8-2.

The messages to be encrypted, known as the plaintext, are transformed by a
function that is parameterized by a key. The output of the encryption process,
known as the ciphertext, is then transmitted, often by messenger or radio. We as-
sume that the enemy, or intruder, hears and accurately copies down the complete
ciphertext. However, unlike the intended recipient, he does not know what the
decryption key is and so cannot decrypt the ciphertext easily. Sometimes the in-
truder can not only listen to the communication channel (passive intruder) but can
also record messages and play them back later, inject his own messages, or modi-
fy legitimate messages before they get to the receiver (active intruder). The art of

---

breaking ciphers, known as cryptanalysis, and the art of devising them (crypto-
graphy) are collectively known as cryptology.
It will often be useful to have a notation for relating plaintext, ciphertext, and
keys. We will use C = EK(P) to mean that the encryption of the plaintext P using
key K gives the ciphertext C. Similarly, P = DK(C) represents the decryption of
C to get the plaintext again. It then follows that
DK(EK(P)) = P
This notation suggests that E and D are just mathematical functions, which they
are. The only tricky part is that both are functions of two parameters, and we
have written one of the parameters (the key) as a subscript, rather than as an argu-
ment, to distinguish it from the message.
A fundamental rule of cryptography is that one must assume that the crypt-
analyst knows the methods used for encryption and decryption. In other words,
the cryptanalyst knows how the encryption method, E, and decryption, D, of
Fig. 8-2 work in detail. The amount of effort necessary to invent, test, and install
a new algorithm every time the old method is compromised (or thought to be
compromised) has always made it impractical to keep the encryption algorithm
secret. Thinking it is secret when it is not does more harm than good.
This is where the key enters. The key consists of a (relatively) short string
that selects one of many potential encryptions. In contrast to the general method,
which may only be changed every few years, the key can be changed as often as
required. Thus, our basic model is a stable and publicly known general method
parameterized by a secret and easily changed key. The idea that the cryptanalyst
knows the algorithms and that the secrecy lies exclusively in the keys is called
Kerckhoff’s principle, named after the Flemish military cryptographer Auguste
Kerckhoff who first stated it in 1883 (Kerckhoff, 1883). Thus, we have
Kerckhoff’s principle: All algorithms must be public; only the keys are secret
The nonsecrecy of the algorithm cannot be emphasized enough. Trying to
keep the algorithm secret, known in the trade as security by obscurity, never
works. Also, by publicizing the algorithm, the cryptographer gets free consulting
from a large number of academic cryptologists eager to break the system so they
can publish papers demonstrating how smart they are. If many experts have tried
to break the algorithm for a long time after its publication and no one has suc-
ceeded, it is probably pretty solid.
Since the real secrecy is in the key, its length is a major design issue. Consid-
er a simple combination lock. The general principle is that you enter digits in se-
quence. Everyone knows this, but the key is secret. A key length of two digits
means that there are 100 possibilities. A key length of three digits means 1000
possibilities, and a key length of six digits means a million. The longer the key,
the higher the work factor the cryptanalyst has to deal with. The work factor for
breaking the system by exhaustive search of the key space is exponential in the

key length. Secrecy comes from having a strong (but public) algorithm and a long
key. To prevent your kid brother from reading your email, 64-bit keys will do.
For routine commercial use, at least 128 bits should be used. To keep major gov-
ernments at bay, keys of at least 256 bits, preferably more, are needed.
From the cryptanalyst’s point of view, the cryptanalysis problem has three
principal variations. When he has a quantity of ciphertext and no plaintext, he is
confronted with the ciphertext-only problem. The cryptograms that appear in the
puzzle section of newspapers pose this kind of problem. When the cryptanalyst
has some matched ciphertext and plaintext, the problem is called the known
plaintext problem.
Finally, when the cryptanalyst has the ability to encrypt
pieces of plaintext of his own choosing, we have the chosen plaintext problem.
Newspaper cryptograms could be broken trivially if the cryptanalyst were allowed
to ask such questions as ‘‘What is the encryption of ABCDEFGHIJKL?’’
Novices in the cryptography business often assume that if a cipher can with-
stand a ciphertext-only attack, it is secure. This assumption is very naive. In
many cases, the cryptanalyst can make a good guess at parts of the plaintext. For
example, the first thing many computers say when you call them up is ‘‘login:’’.
Equipped with some matched plaintext-ciphertext pairs, the cryptanalyst’s job be-
comes much easier. To achieve security, the cryptographer should be conserva-
tive and make sure that the system is unbreakable even if his opponent can en-
crypt arbitrary amounts of chosen plaintext.
Encryption methods have historically been divided into two categories: substi-
tution ciphers and transposition ciphers. We will now deal with each of these
briefly as background information for modern cryptography.
8.1.2 Substitution Ciphers
In a substitution cipher, each letter or group of letters is replaced by another
letter or group of letters to disguise it. One of the oldest known ciphers is the
Caesar cipher, attributed to Julius Caesar. With this method, a becomes D, b be-
comes E, c becomes F, . . . , and z becomes C. For example, attack becomes
DWWDFN. In our examples, plaintext will be given in lowercase letters, and
ciphertext in uppercase letters.
A slight generalization of the Caesar cipher allows the ciphertext alphabet to
be shifted by k letters, instead of always three. In this case, k becomes a key to
the general method of circularly shifted alphabets. The Caesar cipher may have
fooled Pompey, but it has not fooled anyone since.
The next improvement is to have each of the symbols in the plaintext, say, the
26 letters for simplicity, map onto some other letter. For example,
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
Q W E R T Y U I O P A S D F G H J K L Z X C V B N M
plaintext:
ciphertext:

The general system of symbol-for-symbol substitution is called a monoalphabetic
substitution cipher, with the key being the 26-letter string corresponding to the
full alphabet. For the key just given, the plaintext attack would be transformed
into the ciphertext QZZQEA.
At first glance this might appear to be a safe system because although the
cryptanalyst knows the general system (letter-for-letter substitution), he does not
know which of the 26! ∼∼4 × 1026 possible keys is in use. In contrast with the
Caesar cipher, trying all of them is not a promising approach. Even at 1 nsec per
solution, a million computer chips working in parallel would take 10,000 years to
try all the keys.
Nevertheless, given a surprisingly small amount of ciphertext, the cipher can
be broken easily. The basic attack takes advantage of the statistical properties of
natural languages. In English, for example, e is the most common letter, followed
by t, o, a, n, i, etc. The most common two-letter combinations, or digrams, are
th, in, er, re, and an. The most common three-letter combinations, or trigrams,
are the, ing, and, and ion.
A cryptanalyst trying to break a monoalphabetic cipher would start out by
counting the relative frequencies of all letters in the ciphertext. Then he might
tentatively assign the most common one to e and the next most common one to t.
He would then look at trigrams to find a common one of the form tXe, which
strongly suggests that X is h. Similarly, if the pattern thYt occurs frequently, the Y
probably stands for a. With this information, he can look for a frequently oc-
curring trigram of the form aZW, which is most likely and. By making guesses at
common letters, digrams, and trigrams and knowing about likely patterns of
vowels and consonants, the cryptanalyst builds up a tentative plaintext, letter by
letter.
Another approach is to guess a probable word or phrase. For example, con-
sider the following ciphertext from an accounting firm (blocked into groups of
five characters):
CTBMN BYCTC BT JDS QXBNS GST JC BTSWX CTQTZ CQVUJ
QJSGS T JQZZ MNQJS VLNSX VSZ JU
JDSTS
JQUUS
JUBXJ
DSKSU
JSNTK BGAQJ
ZBGYQ TLCTZ BNYBN QJSW
A likely word in a message from an accounting firm is financial. Using our
knowledge that financial has a repeated letter (i), with four other letters between
their occurrences, we look for repeated letters in the ciphertext at this spacing.
We find 12 hits, at positions 6, 15, 27, 31, 42, 48, 56, 66, 70, 71, 76, and 82.
However, only two of these, 31 and 42, have the next letter (corresponding to n in
the plaintext) repeated in the proper place. Of these two, only 31 also has the a
correctly positioned, so we know that financial begins at position 30. From this
point on, deducing the key is easy by using the frequency statistics for English
text and looking for nearly complete words to finish off.

8.1.3 Transposition Ciphers
Substitution ciphers preserve the order of the plaintext symbols but disguise
them. Transposition ciphers, in contrast, reorder the letters but do not disguise
them. Figure 8-3 depicts a common transposition cipher, the columnar transposi-
tion. The cipher is keyed by a word or phrase not containing any repeated letters.
In this example, MEGABUCK is the key. The purpose of the key is to order the
columns, with column 1 being under the key letter closest to the start of the alpha-
bet, and so on. The plaintext is written horizontally, in rows, padded to fill the
matrix if need be. The ciphertext is read out by columns, starting with the column
whose key letter is the lowest.

Figure 8-3. A transposition cipher.
To break a transposition cipher, the cryptanalyst must first be aware that he is
dealing with a transposition cipher. By looking at the frequency of E, T, A, O, I,
N, etc., it is easy to see if they fit the normal pattern for plaintext. If so, the cipher
is clearly a transposition cipher, because in such a cipher every letter represents it-
self, keeping the frequency distribution intact.
The next step is to make a guess at the number of columns. In many cases, a
probable word or phrase may be guessed at from the context. For example, sup-
pose that our cryptanalyst suspects that the plaintext phrase milliondollars occurs
somewhere in the message. Observe that digrams MO, IL, LL, LA, IR, and OS oc-
cur in the ciphertext as a result of this phrase wrapping around. The ciphertext
letter O follows the ciphertext letter M (i.e., they are vertically adjacent in column
4) because they are separated in the probable phrase by a distance equal to the key
length. If a key of length seven had been used, the digrams MD, IO, LL, LL, IA,
OR, and NS would have occurred instead. In fact, for each key length, a different
set of digrams is produced in the ciphertext. By hunting for the various possibili-
ties, the cryptanalyst can often easily determine the key length.

CHAP. 8
The remaining step is to order the columns. When the number of columns, k,
is small, each of the k(k −1) column pairs can be examined in turn to see if its
digram frequencies match those for English plaintext. The pair with the best
match is assumed to be correctly positioned. Now each of the remaining columns
is tentatively tried as the successor to this pair. The column whose digram and tri-
gram frequencies give the best match is tentatively assumed to be correct. The
next column is found in the same way. The entire process is continued until a po-
tential ordering is found. Chances are that the plaintext will be recognizable at
this point (e.g., if milloin occurs, it is clear what the error is).
Some transposition ciphers accept a fixed-length block of input and produce a
fixed-length block of output. These ciphers can be completely described by giv-
ing a list telling the order in which the characters are to be output. For example,
the cipher of Fig. 8-3 can be seen as a 64 character block cipher. Its output is 4,
12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, 5, 13, . . . , 62. In other words, the fourth input charac-
ter, a, is the first to be output, followed by the twelfth, f, and so on.
8.1.4 One-Time Pads
Constructing an unbreakable cipher is actually quite easy; the technique has
been known for decades. First choose a random bit string as the key. Then con-
vert the plaintext into a bit string, for example, by using its ASCII representation.
Finally, compute the XOR (eXclusive OR) of these two strings, bit by bit. The re-
sulting ciphertext cannot be broken because in a sufficiently large sample of
ciphertext, each letter will occur equally often, as will every digram, every tri-
gram, and so on. This method, known as the one-time pad, is immune to all pres-
ent and future attacks, no matter how much computational power the intruder has.
The reason derives from information theory: there is simply no information in the
message because all possible plaintexts of the given length are equally likely.
An example of how one-time pads are used is given in Fig. 8-4. First, mes-
sage 1, ‘‘I love you.’’ is converted to 7-bit ASCII. Then a one-time pad, pad 1, is
chosen and XORed with the message to get the ciphertext. A cryptanalyst could
try all possible one-time pads to see what plaintext came out for each one. For
example, the one-time pad listed as pad 2 in the figure could be tried, resulting in
plaintext 2, ‘‘Elvis lives’’, which may or may not be plausible (a subject beyond
the scope of this book). In fact, for every 11-character ASCII plaintext, there is a
one-time pad that generates it. That is what we mean by saying there is no infor-
mation in the ciphertext: you can get any message of the correct length out of it.
One-time pads are great in theory but have a number of disadvantages in prac-
tice. To start with, the key cannot be memorized, so both sender and receiver
must carry a written copy with them. If either one is subject to capture, written
keys are clearly undesirable. Additionally, the total amount of data that can be
transmitted is limited by the amount of key available. If the spy strikes it rich and
discovers a wealth of data, he may find himself unable to transmit them back to

headquarters because the key has been used up. Another problem is the sensitivi-
ty of the method to lost or inserted characters. If the sender and receiver get out
of synchronization, all data from then on will appear garbled.
With the advent of computers, the one-time pad might potentially become
practical for some applications. The source of the key could be a special DVD
that contains several gigabytes of information and, if transported in a DVD movie
box and prefixed by a few minutes of video, would not even be suspicious. Of
course, at gigabit network speeds, having to insert a new DVD every 30 sec could
become tedious. And the DVDs must be personally carried from the sender to the
receiver before any messages can be sent, which greatly reduces their practical
utility.
Quantum Cryptography
Interestingly, there may be a solution to the problem of how to transmit the
one-time pad over the network, and it comes from a very unlikely source: quant-
um mechanics. This area is still experimental, but initial tests are promising. If it
can be perfected and be made efficient, virtually all cryptography will eventually
be done using one-time pads since they are provably secure. Below we will brief-
ly explain how this method, quantum cryptography, works. In particular, we
will describe a protocol called BB84 after its authors and publication year (Bennet
and Brassard, 1984).
Suppose that a user, Alice, wants to establish a one-time pad with a second
user, Bob. Alice and Bob are called principals, the main characters in our story.
For example, Bob is a banker with whom Alice would like to do business. The
names ‘‘Alice’’ and ‘‘Bob’’ have been used for the principals in virtually every
paper and book on cryptography since Ron Rivest introduced them many years
ago (Rivest et al., 1978). Cryptographers love tradition. If we were to use
‘‘Andy’’ and ‘‘Barbara’’ as the principals, no one would believe anything in this
chapter. So be it.
If Alice and Bob could establish a one-time pad, they could use it to commun-
icate securely. The question is: how can they establish it without previously
exchanging DVDs? We can assume that Alice and Bob are at the opposite ends

of an optical fiber over which they can send and receive light pulses. However,
an intrepid intruder, Trudy, can cut the fiber to splice in an active tap. Trudy can
read all the bits sent in both directions. She can also send false messages in both
directions. The situation might seem hopeless for Alice and Bob, but quantum
cryptography can shed some new light on the subject.
Quantum cryptography is based on the fact that light comes in little packets
called photons, which have some peculiar properties. Furthermore, light can be
polarized by being passed through a polarizing filter, a fact well known to both
sunglasses wearers and photographers. If a beam of light (i.e., a stream of pho-
tons) is passed through a polarizing filter, all the photons emerging from it will be
polarized in the direction of the filter’s axis (e.g., vertically). If the beam is now
passed through a second polarizing filter, the intensity of the light emerging from
the second filter is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between
the axes. If the two axes are perpendicular, no photons get through. The absolute
orientation of the two filters does not matter; only the angle between their axes
counts.
To generate a one-time pad, Alice needs two sets of polarizing filters. Set one
consists of a vertical filter and a horizontal filter. This choice is called a rectil-
inear basis. A basis (plural: bases) is just a coordinate system. The second set of
filters is the same, except rotated 45 degrees, so one filter runs from the lower left
to the upper right and the other filter runs from the upper left to the lower right.
This choice is called a diagonal basis. Thus, Alice has two bases, which she can
rapidly insert into her beam at will. In reality, Alice does not have four separate
filters, but a crystal whose polarization can be switched electrically to any of the
four allowed directions at great speed. Bob has the same equipment as Alice.
The fact that Alice and Bob each have two bases available is essential to quantum
cryptography.
For each basis, Alice now assigns one direction as 0 and the other as 1. In the
example presented below, we assume she chooses vertical to be 0 and horizontal
to be 1. Independently, she also chooses lower left to upper right as 0 and upper
left to lower right as 1. She sends these choices to Bob as plaintext.
Now Alice picks a one-time pad, for example based on a random number gen-
erator (a complex subject all by itself). She transfers it bit by bit to Bob, choosing
one of her two bases at random for each bit. To send a bit, her photon gun emits
one photon polarized appropriately for the basis she is using for that bit. For ex-
ample, she might choose bases of diagonal, rectilinear, rectilinear, diagonal, rec-
tilinear, etc. To send her one-time pad of 1001110010100110 with these bases,
she would send the photons shown in Fig. 8-5(a). Given the one-time pad and the
sequence of bases, the polarization to use for each bit is uniquely determined.
Bits sent one photon at a time are called qubits.
Bob does not know which bases to use, so he picks one at random for each ar-
riving photon and just uses it, as shown in Fig. 8-5(b). If he picks the correct
basis, he gets the correct bit. If he picks the incorrect basis, he gets a random bit

because if a photon hits a filter polarized at 45 degrees to its own polarization, it
randomly jumps to the polarization of the filter or to a polarization perpendicular
to the filter, with equal probability. This property of photons is fundamental to
quantum mechanics. Thus, some of the bits are correct and some are random, but
Bob does not know which are which. Bob’s results are depicted in Fig. 8-5(c).
How does Bob find out which bases he got right and which he got wrong? He
simply tells Alice which basis he used for each bit in plaintext and she tells him
which are right and which are wrong in plaintext, as shown in Fig. 8-5(d). From
this information, both of them can build a bit string from the correct guesses, as
shown in Fig. 8-5(e). On the average, this bit string will be half the length of the
original bit string, but since both parties know it, they can use it as a one-time pad.
All Alice has to do is transmit a bit string slightly more than twice the desired
length, and she and Bob will have a one-time pad of the desired length. Done.
But wait a minute. We forgot Trudy. Suppose that she is curious about what
Alice has to say and cuts the fiber, inserting her own detector and transmitter.
Unfortunately for her, she does not know which basis to use for each photon ei-
ther. The best she can do is pick one at random for each photon, just as Bob does.
An example of her choices is shown in Fig. 8-5(f). When Bob later reports (in
plaintext) which bases he used and Alice tells him (in plaintext) which ones are

correct, Trudy now knows when she got it right and when she got it wrong. In
Fig. 8-5, she got it right for bits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 13. But she knows from
Alice’s reply in Fig. 8-5(d) that only bits 1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14 are part of
the one-time pad. For four of these bits (1, 3, 8, and 12), she guessed right and
captured the correct bit. For the other four (7, 10, 11, and 14), she guessed wrong
and does not know the bit transmitted. Thus, Bob knows the one-time pad starts
with 01011001, from Fig. 8-5(e) but all Trudy has is 01?1??0?, from Fig. 8-5(g).
Of course, Alice and Bob are aware that Trudy may have captured part of
their one-time pad, so they would like to reduce the information Trudy has. They
can do this by performing a transformation on it. For example, they could divide
the one-time pad into blocks of 1024 bits, square each one to form a 2048-bit
number, and use the concatenation of these 2048-bit numbers as the one-time pad.
With her partial knowledge of the bit string transmitted, Trudy has no way to gen-
erate its square and so has nothing. The transformation from the original one-time
pad to a different one that reduces Trudy’s knowledge is called privacy amplifi-
cation. In practice, complex transformations in which every output bit depends
on every input bit are used instead of squaring.
Poor Trudy. Not only does she have no idea what the one-time pad is, but her
presence is not a secret either. After all, she must relay each received bit to Bob
to trick him into thinking he is talking to Alice. The trouble is, the best she can do
is transmit the qubit she received, using the polarization she used to receive it, and
about half the time she will be wrong, causing many errors in Bob’s one-time pad.
When Alice finally starts sending data, she encodes it using a heavy forward-
error-correcting code. From Bob’s point of view, a 1-bit error in the one-time pad
is the same as a 1-bit transmission error. Either way, he gets the wrong bit. If
there is enough forward error correction, he can recover the original message
despite all the errors, but he can easily count how many errors were corrected. If
this number is far more than the expected error rate of the equipment, he knows
that Trudy has tapped the line and can act accordingly (e.g., tell Alice to switch to
a radio channel, call the police, etc.). If Trudy had a way to clone a photon so she
had one photon to inspect and an identical photon to send to Bob, she could avoid
detection, but at present no way to clone a photon perfectly is known. And even if
Trudy could clone photons, the value of quantum cryptography to establish one-
time pads would not be reduced.
Although quantum cryptography has been shown to operate over distances of
60 km of fiber, the equipment is complex and expensive. Still, the idea has prom-
ise. For more information about quantum cryptography, see Mullins (2002).
8.1.5 Two Fundamental Cryptographic Principles
Although we will study many different cryptographic systems in the pages
ahead, two principles underlying all of them are important to understand. Pay
attention. You violate them at your peril.

---

## Page 15

SEC. 8.1
CRYPTOGRAPHY
777
Redundancy
The first principle is that all encrypted messages must contain some redun-
dancy, that is, information not needed to understand the message. An example
may make it clear why this is needed. Consider a mail-order company, The
Couch Potato (TCP), with 60,000 products. Thinking they are being very effi-
cient, TCP’s programmers decide that ordering messages should consist of a 16-
byte customer name followed by a 3-byte data field (1 byte for the quantity and 2
bytes for the product number). The last 3 bytes are to be encrypted using a very
long key known only by the customer and TCP.
At first, this might seem secure, and in a sense it is because passive intruders
cannot decrypt the messages. Unfortunately, it also has a fatal flaw that renders it
useless. Suppose that a recently fired employee wants to punish TCP for firing
her. Just before leaving, she takes the customer list with her. She works through
the night writing a program to generate fictitious orders using real customer
names. Since she does not have the list of keys, she just puts random numbers in
the last 3 bytes, and sends hundreds of orders off to TCP.
When these messages arrive, TCP’s computer uses the customers’ name to
locate the key and decrypt the message. Unfortunately for TCP, almost every 3-
byte message is valid, so the computer begins printing out shipping instructions.
While it might seem odd for a customer to order 837 sets of children’s swings or
540 sandboxes, for all the computer knows, the customer might be planning to
open a chain of franchised playgrounds. In this way, an active intruder (the ex-
employee) can cause a massive amount of trouble, even though she cannot under-
stand the messages her computer is generating.
This problem can be solved by the addition of redundancy to all messages.
For example, if order messages are extended to 12 bytes, the first 9 of which must
be zeros, this attack no longer works because the ex-employee can no longer gen-
erate a large stream of valid messages. The moral of the story is that all messages
must contain considerable redundancy so that active intruders cannot send random
junk and have it be interpreted as a valid message.
However, adding redundancy makes it easier for cryptanalysts to break mes-
sages. Suppose that the mail-order business is highly competitive, and The Couch
Potato’s main competitor, The Sofa Tuber, would dearly love to know how many
sandboxes TCP is selling so it taps TCP’s phone line. In the original scheme with
3-byte messages, cryptanalysis was nearly impossible because after guessing a
key, the cryptanalyst had no way of telling whether it was right because almost
every message was technically legal. With the new 12-byte scheme, it is easy for
the cryptanalyst to tell a valid message from an invalid one. Thus, we have
Cryptographic principle 1: Messages must contain some redundancy
In other words, upon decrypting a message, the recipient must be able to tell
whether it is valid by simply inspecting the message and perhaps performing a

simple computation. This redundancy is needed to prevent active intruders from
sending garbage and tricking the receiver into decrypting the garbage and acting
on the ‘‘plaintext.’’ However, this same redundancy makes it much easier for pas-
sive intruders to break the system, so there is some tension here. Furthermore, the
redundancy should never be in the form of n 0s at the start or end of a message,
since running such messages through some cryptographic algorithms gives more
predictable results, making the cryptanalysts’ job easier. A CRC polynomial is
much better than a run of 0s since the receiver can easily verify it, but it generates
more work for the cryptanalyst. Even better is to use a cryptographic hash, a con-
cept we will explore later. For the moment, think of it as a better CRC.
Getting back to quantum cryptography for a moment, we can also see how re-
dundancy plays a role there. Due to Trudy’s interception of the photons, some
bits in Bob’s one-time pad will be wrong. Bob needs some redundancy in the in-
coming messages to determine that errors are present. One very crude form of re-
dundancy is repeating the message two times. If the two copies are not identical,
Bob knows that either the fiber is very noisy or someone is tampering with the
transmission. Of course, sending everything twice is overkill; a Hamming or
Reed-Solomon code is a more efficient way to do error detection and correction.
But it should be clear that some redundancy is needed to distinguish a valid mes-
sage from an invalid message, especially in the face of an active intruder.
Freshness
The second cryptographic principle is that measures must be taken to ensure
that each message received can be verified as being fresh, that is, sent very
recently. This measure is needed to prevent active intruders from playing back
old messages. If no such measures were taken, our ex-employee could tap TCP’s
phone line and just keep repeating previously sent valid messages. Thus,
Cryptographic principle 2: Some method is needed to foil replay attacks
One such measure is including in every message a timestamp valid only for, say,
10 seconds. The receiver can then just keep messages around for 10 seconds and
compare newly arrived messages to previous ones to filter out duplicates. Mes-
sages older than 10 seconds can be thrown out, since any replays sent more than
10 seconds later will be rejected as too old. Measures other than timestamps will
be discussed later.
8.2 SYMMETRIC-KEY ALGORITHMS
Modern cryptography uses the same basic ideas as traditional cryptography
(transposition and substitution), but its emphasis is different. Traditionally, cryp-
tographers have used simple algorithms. Nowadays, the reverse is true: the object

is to make the encryption algorithm so complex and involuted that even if the
cryptanalyst acquires vast mounds of enciphered text of his own choosing, he will
not be able to make any sense of it at all without the key.
The first class of encryption algorithms we will study in this chapter are call-
ed symmetric-key algorithms because they use the same key for encryption and
decryption. Fig. 8-2 illustrates the use of a symmetric-key algorithm. In particu-
lar, we will focus on block ciphers, which take an n-bit block of plaintext as
input and transform it using the key into an n-bit block of ciphertext.
Cryptographic algorithms can be implemented in either hardware (for speed)
or software (for flexibility). Although most of our treatment concerns the algo-
rithms and protocols, which are independent of the actual implementation, a few
words about building cryptographic hardware may be of interest. Transpositions
and substitutions can be implemented with simple electrical circuits. Figure 8-
6(a) shows a device, known as a P-box (P stands for permutation), used to effect a
transposition on an 8-bit input. If the 8 bits are designated from top to bottom as
01234567, the output of this particular P-box is 36071245. By appropriate inter-
nal wiring, a P-box can be made to perform any transposition and do it at practi-
cally the speed of light since no computation is involved, just signal propagation.
This design follows Kerckhoff’s principle: the attacker knows that the general
method is permuting the bits. What he does not know is which bit goes where.

Substitutions are performed by S-boxes, as shown in Fig. 8-6(b). In this ex-
ample, a 3-bit plaintext is entered and a 3-bit ciphertext is output. The 3-bit input
selects one of the eight lines exiting from the first stage and sets it to 1; all the
other lines are 0. The second stage is a P-box. The third stage encodes the selec-
ted input line in binary again. With the wiring shown, if the eight octal numbers
01234567 were input one after another, the output sequence would be 24506713.
In other words, 0 has been replaced by 2, 1 has been replaced by 4, etc. Again, by
appropriate wiring of the P-box inside the S-box, any substitution can be accom-
plished. Furthermore, such a device can be built in hardware to achieve great
speed, since encoders and decoders have only one or two (subnanosecond) gate
delays and the propagation time across the P-box may well be less than 1 picosec.

The real power of these basic elements only becomes apparent when we cas-
cade a whole series of boxes to form a product cipher, as shown in Fig. 8-6(c).
In this example, 12 input lines are transposed (i.e., permuted) by the first stage
(P 1). In the second stage, the input is broken up into four groups of 3 bits, each of
which is substituted independently of the others (S 1 to S 4). This arrangement
shows a method of approximating a larger S-box from multiple, smaller S-boxes.
It is useful because small S-boxes are practical for a hardware implementation
(e.g., an 8-bit S-box can be realized as a 256-entry lookup table), but large S-
boxes become unwieldy to build (e.g., a 12-bit S-box would at a minimum need
212 = 4096 crossed wires in its middle stage). Although this method is less gener-
al, it is still powerful. By inclusion of a sufficiently large number of stages in the
product cipher, the output can be made to be an exceedingly complicated function
of the input.
Product ciphers that operate on k-bit inputs to produce k-bit outputs are very
common. Typically, k is 64 to 256. A hardware implementation usually has at
least 10 physical stages, instead of just 7 as in Fig. 8-6(c). A software imple-
mentation is programmed as a loop with at least eight iterations, each one per-
forming S-box-type substitutions on subblocks of the 64- to 256-bit data block,
followed by a permutation that mixes the outputs of the S-boxes. Often there is a
special initial permutation and one at the end as well. In the literature, the itera-
tions are called rounds.
8.2.1 DES—The Data Encryption Standard
In January 1977, the U.S. Government adopted a product cipher developed by
IBM as its official standard for unclassified information. This cipher, DES (Data
Encryption Standard), was widely adopted by the industry for use in security
products. It is no longer secure in its original form, but in a modified form it is
still useful. We will now explain how DES works.
An outline of DES is shown in Fig. 8-7(a). Plaintext is encrypted in blocks of
64 bits, yielding 64 bits of ciphertext. The algorithm, which is parameterized by a
56-bit key, has 19 distinct stages. The first stage is a key-independent transposi-
tion on the 64-bit plaintext. The last stage is the exact inverse of this transposi-
tion. The stage prior to the last one exchanges the leftmost 32 bits with the right-
most 32 bits. The remaining 16 stages are functionally identical but are parame-
terized by different functions of the key. The algorithm has been designed to
allow decryption to be done with the same key as encryption, a property needed in
any symmetric-key algorithm. The steps are just run in the reverse order.
The operation of one of these intermediate stages is illustrated in Fig. 8-7(b).
Each stage takes two 32-bit inputs and produces two 32-bit outputs. The left out-
put is simply a copy of the right input. The right output is the bitwise XOR of the
left input and a function of the right input and the key for this stage, Ki. Pretty
much all the complexity of the algorithm lies in this function.

one iteration. The circled + means exclusive OR.
The function consists of four steps, carried out in sequence. First, a 48-bit
number, E, is constructed by expanding the 32-bit Ri −1 according to a fixed
transposition and duplication rule. Second, E and Ki are XORed together. This
output is then partitioned into eight groups of 6 bits each, each of which is fed into
a different S-box. Each of the 64 possible inputs to an S-box is mapped onto a 4-
bit output. Finally, these 8 × 4 bits are passed through a P-box.
In each of the 16 iterations, a different key is used. Before the algorithm
starts, a 56-bit transposition is applied to the key. Just before each iteration, the
key is partitioned into two 28-bit units, each of which is rotated left by a number
of bits dependent on the iteration number. Ki is derived from this rotated key by
applying yet another 56-bit transposition to it. A different 48-bit subset of the 56
bits is extracted and permuted on each round.
A technique that is sometimes used to make DES stronger is called whiten-
ing. It consists of XORing a random 64-bit key with each plaintext block before
feeding it into DES and then XORing a second 64-bit key with the resulting
ciphertext before transmitting it. Whitening can easily be removed by running the

---

## Page 20

782

CHAP. 8
reverse operations (if the receiver has the two whitening keys). Since this techni-
que effectively adds more bits to the key length, it makes an exhaustive search of
the key space much more time consuming. Note that the same whitening key is
used for each block (i.e., there is only one whitening key).
DES has been enveloped in controversy since the day it was launched. It was
based on a cipher developed and patented by IBM, called Lucifer, except that
IBM’s cipher used a 128-bit key instead of a 56-bit key. When the U.S. Federal
Government wanted to standardize on one cipher for unclassified use, it ‘‘invited’’
IBM to ‘‘discuss’’ the matter with NSA, the U.S. Government’s code-breaking
arm, which is the world’s largest employer of mathematicians and cryptologists.
NSA is so secret that an industry joke goes:
Q: What does NSA stand for?
A: No Such Agency.
Actually, NSA stands for National Security Agency.
After these discussions took place, IBM reduced the key from 128 bits to 56
bits and decided to keep secret the process by which DES was designed. Many
people suspected that the key length was reduced to make sure that NSA could
just break DES, but no organization with a smaller budget could. The point of the
secret design was supposedly to hide a back door that could make it even easier
for NSA to break DES. When an NSA employee discreetly told IEEE to cancel a
planned conference on cryptography, that did not make people any more comfort-
able. NSA denied everything.
In 1977, two Stanford cryptography researchers, Diffie and Hellman (1977),
designed a machine to break DES and estimated that it could be built for 20 mil-
lion dollars. Given a small piece of plaintext and matched ciphertext, this ma-
chine could find the key by exhaustive search of the 256-entry key space in under
1 day. Nowadays, the game is up. Such a machine exists, is for sale, and costs
less than $10,000 to make (Kumar et al., 2006).
Triple DES
As early as 1979, IBM realized that the DES key length was too short and de-
vised a way to effectively increase it, using triple encryption (Tuchman, 1979).
The method chosen, which has since been incorporated in International Standard
8732, is illustrated in Fig. 8-8. Here, two keys and three stages are used. In the
first stage, the plaintext is encrypted using DES in the usual way with K 1. In the
second stage, DES is run in decryption mode, using K 2 as the key. Finally, anoth-
er DES encryption is done with K 1.
This design immediately gives rise to two questions. First, why are only two
keys used, instead of three? Second, why is EDE (Encrypt Decrypt Encrypt)
used, instead of EEE (Encrypt Encrypt Encrypt)? The reason that two keys are
used is that even the most paranoid of cryptographers believe that 112 bits is

adequate for routine commercial applications for the time being. (And among
cryptographers, paranoia is considered a feature, not a bug.) Going to 168 bits
would just add the unnecessary overhead of managing and transporting another
key for little real gain.
The reason for encrypting, decrypting, and then encrypting again is backward
compatibility with existing single-key DES systems. Both the encryption and de-
cryption functions are mappings between sets of 64-bit numbers. From a crypto-
graphic point of view, the two mappings are equally strong. By using EDE, how-
ever, instead of EEE, a computer using triple encryption can speak to one using
single encryption by just setting K 1 = K 2. This property allows triple encryption
to be phased in gradually, something of no concern to academic cryptographers
but of considerable importance to IBM and its customers.
8.2.2 AES—The Advanced Encryption Standard
As DES began approaching the end of its useful life, even with triple DES,
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), the agency of the U.S.
Dept. of Commerce charged with approving standards for the U.S. Federal Gov-
ernment, decided that the government needed a new cryptographic standard for
unclassified use. NIST was keenly aware of all the controversy surrounding DES
and well knew that if it just announced a new standard, everyone knowing any-
thing about cryptography would automatically assume that NSA had built a back
door into it so NSA could read everything encrypted with it. Under these condi-
tions, probably no one would use the standard and it would have died quietly.
So, NIST took a surprisingly different approach for a government bureau-
cracy: it sponsored a cryptographic bake-off (contest).
In January 1997, re-
searchers from all over the world were invited to submit proposals for a new stan-
dard, to be called AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). The bake-off rules
were:
1. The algorithm must be a symmetric block cipher.
2. The full design must be public.
3. Key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits must be supported.

---

## Page 22

784
NETWORK SECURITY
CHAP. 8
4. Both software and hardware implementations must be possible.
5. The algorithm must be public or licensed on nondiscriminatory terms.
Fifteen serious proposals were made, and public conferences were organized in
which they were presented and attendees were actively encouraged to find flaws
in all of them. In August 1998, NIST selected five finalists, primarily on the basis
of their security, efficiency, simplicity, flexibility, and memory requirements (im-
portant for embedded systems). More conferences were held and more potshots
taken.
In October 2000, NIST announced that it had selected Rijndael, by Joan Dae-
men and Vincent Rijmen. The name Rijndael, pronounced Rhine-doll (more or
less), is derived from the last names of the authors: Rijmen + Daemen.
In
November 2001, Rijndael became the AES U.S. Government standard, published
as FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 197. Due to the extraordinary
openness of the competition, the technical properties of Rijndael, and the fact that
the winning team consisted of two young Belgian cryptographers (who were
unlikely to have built in a back door just to please NSA), Rijndael has become the
world’s dominant cryptographic cipher. AES encryption and decryption is now
part of the instruction set for some microprocessors (e.g., Intel).
Rijndael supports key lengths and block sizes from 128 bits to 256 bits in
steps of 32 bits. The key length and block length may be chosen independently.
However, AES specifies that the block size must be 128 bits and the key length
must be 128, 192, or 256 bits. It is doubtful that anyone will ever use 192-bit
keys, so de facto, AES has two variants: a 128-bit block with a 128-bit key and a
128-bit block with a 256-bit key.
In our treatment of the algorithm, we will examine only the 128/128 case be-
cause this is likely to become the commercial norm. A 128-bit key gives a key
space of 2128 ∼∼3 × 1038 keys. Even if NSA manages to build a machine with 1
billion parallel processors, each being able to evaluate one key per picosecond, it
would take such a machine about 1010 years to search the key space. By then the
sun will have burned out, so the folks then present will have to read the results by
candlelight.
Rijndael
From a mathematical perspective, Rijndael is based on Galois field theory,
which gives it some provable security properties. However, it can also be viewed
as C code, without getting into the mathematics.
Like DES, Rijndael uses substitution and permutations, and it also uses multi-
ple rounds. The number of rounds depends on the key size and block size, being
10 for 128-bit keys with 128-bit blocks and moving up to 14 for the largest key or
the largest block. However, unlike DES, all operations involve entire bytes, to

allow for efficient implementations in both hardware and software. An outline of
the code is given in Fig. 8-9. Note that this code is for the purpose of illustration.
Good implementations of security code will follow additional practices, such as
zeroing out sensitive memory after it has been used. See, for example, Ferguson
et al. (2010).

The function rijndael has three parameters. They are: plaintext, an array of
16 bytes containing the input data; ciphertext, an array of 16 bytes where the enci-
phered output will be returned; and key, the 16-byte key. During the calculation,
the current state of the data is maintained in a byte array, state, whose size is
NROWS × NCOLS. For 128-bit blocks, this array is 4 × 4 bytes. With 16 bytes,
the full 128-bit data block can be stored.
The state array is initialized to the plaintext and modified by every step in the
computation. In some steps, byte-for-byte substitution is performed. In others,
the bytes are permuted within the array. Other transformations are also used. At
the end, the contents of the state are returned as the ciphertext.
The code starts out by expanding the key into 11 arrays of the same size as the
state. They are stored in rk, which is an array of structs, each containing a state
array. One of these will be used at the start of the calculation and the other 10
will be used during the 10 rounds, one per round. The calculation of the round

keys from the encryption key is too complicated for us to get into here. Suffice it
to say that the round keys are produced by repeated rotation and XORing of vari-
ous groups of key bits. For all the details, see Daemen and Rijmen (2002).
The next step is to copy the plaintext into the state array so it can be proc-
essed during the rounds. It is copied in column order, with the first 4 bytes going
into column 0, the next 4 bytes going into column 1, and so on. Both the columns
and the rows are numbered starting at 0, although the rounds are numbered start-
ing at 1. This initial setup of the 12 byte arrays of size 4 × 4 is illustrated in
Fig. 8-10.

There is one more step before the main computation begins: rk[0] is XORed
into state, byte for byte. In other words, each of the 16 bytes in state is replaced
by the XOR of itself and the corresponding byte in rk[0].
Now it is time for the main attraction. The loop executes 10 iterations, one
per round, transforming state on each iteration. The contents of each round is pro-
duced in four steps. Step 1 does a byte-for-byte substitution on state. Each byte
in turn is used as an index into an S-box to replace its value by the contents of that
S-box entry. This step is a straight monoalphabetic substitution cipher. Unlike
DES, which has multiple S-boxes, Rijndael has only one S-box.
Step 2 rotates each of the four rows to the left. Row 0 is rotated 0 bytes (i.e.,
not changed), row 1 is rotated 1 byte, row 2 is rotated 2 bytes, and row 3 is rotated
3 bytes. This step diffuses the contents of the current data around the block, anal-
ogous to the permutations of Fig. 8-6.
Step 3 mixes up each column independently of the other ones. The mixing is
done using matrix multiplication in which the new column is the product of the
old column and a constant matrix, with the multiplication done using the finite
Galois field, GF(28). Although this may sound complicated, an algorithm exists
that allows each element of the new column to be computed using two table look-
ups and three XORs (Daemen and Rijmen, 2002, Appendix E).

Finally, step 4 XORs the key for this round into the state array for use in the
next round.
Since every step is reversible, decryption can be done just by running the al-
gorithm backward. However, there is also a trick available in which decryption
can be done by running the encryption algorithm using different tables.
The algorithm has been designed not only for great security, but also for great
speed. A good software implementation on a 2-GHz machine should be able to
achieve an encryption rate of 700 Mbps, which is fast enough to encrypt over 100
MPEG-2 videos in real time. Hardware implementations are faster still.
8.2.3 Cipher Modes
Despite all this complexity, AES (or DES, or any block cipher for that matter)
is basically a monoalphabetic substitution cipher using big characters (128-bit
characters for AES and 64-bit characters for DES). Whenever the same plaintext
block goes in the front end, the same ciphertext block comes out the back end. If
you encrypt the plaintext abcdefgh 100 times with the same DES key, you get the
same ciphertext 100 times. An intruder can exploit this property to help subvert
the cipher.
Electronic Code Book Mode
To see how this monoalphabetic substitution cipher property can be used to
partially defeat the cipher, we will use (triple) DES because it is easier to depict
64-bit blocks than 128-bit blocks, but AES has exactly the same problem. The
straightforward way to use DES to encrypt a long piece of plaintext is to break it
up into consecutive 8-byte (64-bit) blocks and encrypt them one after another with
the same key. The last piece of plaintext is padded out to 64 bits, if need be. This
technique is known as ECB mode (Electronic Code Book mode) in analogy with
old-fashioned code books where each plaintext word was listed, followed by its
ciphertext (usually a five-digit decimal number).
In Fig. 8-11, we have the start of a computer file listing the annual bonuses a
company has decided to award to its employees. This file consists of consecutive
32-byte records, one per employee, in the format shown: 16 bytes for the name, 8
bytes for the position, and 8 bytes for the bonus. Each of the sixteen 8-byte
blocks (numbered from 0 to 15) is encrypted by (triple) DES.
Leslie just had a fight with the boss and is not expecting much of a bonus.
Kim, in contrast, is the boss’ favorite, and everyone knows this. Leslie can get ac-
cess to the file after it is encrypted but before it is sent to the bank. Can Leslie
rectify this unfair situation, given only the encrypted file?
No problem at all. All Leslie has to do is make a copy of the 12th ciphertext
block (which contains Kim’s bonus) and use it to replace the fourth ciphertext
block (which contains Leslie’s bonus). Even without knowing what the 12th

block says, Leslie can expect to have a much merrier Christmas this year. (Copy-
ing the eighth ciphertext block is also a possibility, but is more likely to be detect-
ed; besides, Leslie is not a greedy person.)
Cipher Block Chaining Mode
To thwart this type of attack, all block ciphers can be chained in various ways
so that replacing a block the way Leslie did will cause the plaintext decrypted
starting at the replaced block to be garbage. One way of chaining is cipher block
chaining. In this method, shown in Fig. 8-12, each plaintext block is XORed with
the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. Consequently, the same
plaintext block no longer maps onto the same ciphertext block, and the encryption
is no longer a big monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The first block is XORed
with a randomly chosen IV (Initialization Vector), which is transmitted (in plain-
text) along with the ciphertext.

Figure 8-12. Cipher block chaining. (a) Encryption. (b) Decryption.
We can see how cipher block chaining mode works by examining the example
of Fig. 8-12. We start out by computing C 0 = E(P 0 XOR IV). Then we compute
C 1 = E(P 1 XOR C 0), and so on. Decryption also uses XOR to reverse the proc-
ess, with P 0 = IV XOR D(C 0), and so on. Note that the encryption of block i is a

function of all the plaintext in blocks 0 through i −1, so the same plaintext gener-
ates different ciphertext depending on where it occurs. A transformation of the
type Leslie made will result in nonsense for two blocks starting at Leslie’s bonus
field. To an astute security officer, this peculiarity might suggest where to start
the ensuing investigation.
Cipher block chaining also has the advantage that the same plaintext block
will not result in the same ciphertext block, making cryptanalysis more difficult.
In fact, this is the main reason it is used.
Cipher Feedback Mode
However, cipher block chaining has the disadvantage of requiring an entire
64-bit block to arrive before decryption can begin. For byte-by-byte encryption,
cipher feedback mode using (triple) DES is used, as shown in Fig. 8-13. For
AES, the idea is exactly the same, only a 128-bit shift register is used. In this fig-
ure, the state of the encryption machine is shown after bytes 0 through 9 have
been encrypted and sent. When plaintext byte 10 arrives, as illustrated in Fig. 8-
13(a), the DES algorithm operates on the 64-bit shift register to generate a 64-bit
ciphertext. The leftmost byte of that ciphertext is extracted and XORed with P 10.
That byte is transmitted on the transmission line. In addition, the shift register is
shifted left 8 bits, causing C 2 to fall off the left end, and C 10 is inserted in the
position just vacated at the right end by C 9.

Note that the contents of the shift register depend on the entire previous his-
tory of the plaintext, so a pattern that repeats multiple times in the plaintext will
be encrypted differently each time in the ciphertext. As with cipher block chain-
ing, an initialization vector is needed to start the ball rolling.

Decryption with cipher feedback mode works the same way as encryption. In
particular, the content of the shift register is encrypted, not decrypted, so the se-
lected byte that is XORed with C 10 to get P 10 is the same one that was XORed
with P 10 to generate C 10 in the first place. As long as the two shift registers
remain identical, decryption works correctly. This is illustrated in Fig. 8-13(b).
A problem with cipher feedback mode is that if one bit of the ciphertext is ac-
cidentally inverted during transmission, the 8 bytes that are decrypted while the
bad byte is in the shift register will be corrupted. Once the bad byte is pushed out
of the shift register, correct plaintext will once again be generated. Thus, the ef-
fects of a single inverted bit are relatively localized and do not ruin the rest of the
message, but they do ruin as many bits as the shift register is wide.
Stream Cipher Mode
Nevertheless, applications exist in which having a 1-bit transmission error
mess up 64 bits of plaintext is too large an effect. For these applications, a fourth
option, stream cipher mode, exists. It works by encrypting an initialization vec-
tor, using a key to get an output block. The output block is then encrypted, using
the key to get a second output block. This block is then encrypted to get a third
block, and so on. The (arbitrarily large) sequence of output blocks, called the
keystream, is treated like a one-time pad and XORed with the plaintext to get the
ciphertext, as shown in Fig. 8-14(a). Note that the IV is used only on the first
step. After that, the output is encrypted. Also note that the keystream is indepen-
dent of the data, so it can be computed in advance, if need be, and is completely
insensitive to transmission errors. Decryption is shown in Fig. 8-14(b).

Decryption occurs by generating the same keystream at the receiving side.
Since the keystream depends only on the IV and the key, it is not affected by
transmission errors in the ciphertext. Thus, a 1-bit error in the transmitted cipher-
text generates only a 1-bit error in the decrypted plaintext.

It is essential never to use the same (key, IV) pair twice with a stream cipher
because doing so will generate the same keystream each time. Using the same
keystream twice exposes the ciphertext to a keystream reuse attack. Imagine
that the plaintext block, P 0, is encrypted with the keystream to get P 0 XOR K 0.
Later, a second plaintext block, Q 0, is encrypted with the same keystream to get
Q 0 XOR K 0. An intruder who captures both of these ciphertext blocks can sim-
ply XOR them together to get P 0 XOR Q 0, which eliminates the key. The intrud-
er now has the XOR of the two plaintext blocks. If one of them is known or can
be guessed, the other can also be found. In any event, the XOR of two plaintext
streams can be attacked by using statistical properties of the message. For ex-
ample, for English text, the most common character in the stream will probably be
the XOR of two spaces, followed by the XOR of space and the letter ‘‘e’’, etc. In
short, equipped with the XOR of two plaintexts, the cryptanalyst has an excellent
chance of deducing both of them.
Counter Mode
One problem that all the modes except electronic code book mode have is that
random access to encrypted data is impossible. For example, suppose a file is
transmitted over a network and then stored on disk in encrypted form. This might
be a reasonable way to operate if the receiving computer is a notebook computer
that might be stolen. Storing all critical files in encrypted form greatly reduces
the damage due to secret information leaking out in the event that the computer
falls into the wrong hands.
However, disk files are often accessed in nonsequential order, especially files
in databases. With a file encrypted using cipher block chaining, accessing a ran-
dom block requires first decrypting all the blocks ahead of it, an expensive
proposition. For this reason, yet another mode has been invented: counter mode,
as illustrated in Fig. 8-15. Here, the plaintext is not encrypted directly. Instead,
the initialization vector plus a constant is encrypted, and the resulting ciphertext is
XORed with the plaintext. By stepping the initialization vector by 1 for each new
block, it is easy to decrypt a block anywhere in the file without first having to de-
crypt all of its predecessors.
Although counter mode is useful, it has a weakness that is worth pointing out.
Suppose that the same key, K, is used again in the future (with a different plain-
text but the same IV) and an attacker acquires all the ciphertext from both runs.
The keystreams are the same in both cases, exposing the cipher to a keystream
reuse attack of the same kind we saw with stream ciphers. All the cryptanalyst
has to do is XOR the two ciphertexts together to eliminate all the cryptographic
protection and just get the XOR of the plaintexts. This weakness does not mean
counter mode is a bad idea. It just means that both keys and initialization vectors
should be chosen independently and at random. Even if the same key is accide-
ntally used twice, if the IV is different each time, the plaintext is safe.

8.2.4 Other Ciphers
AES (Rijndael) and DES are the best-known symmetric-key cryptographic al-
gorithms, and the standard industry choices, if only for liability reasons. (No one
will blame you if you use AES in your product and AES is cracked, but they will
certainly blame you if you use a nonstandard cipher and it is later broken.) How-
ever, it is worth mentioning that numerous other symmetric-key ciphers have been
devised. Some of these are embedded inside various products. A few of the more
common ones are listed in Fig. 8-16. It is possible to use combinations of these
ciphers, for example, AES over Twofish, so that both ciphers need to be broken to
recover the data.

8.2.5 Cryptanalysis
Before leaving the subject of symmetric-key cryptography, it is worth at least
mentioning four developments in cryptanalysis. The first development is dif-
ferential cryptanalysis (Biham and Shamir, 1997). This technique can be used

793
to attack any block cipher. It works by beginning with a pair of plaintext blocks
differing in only a small number of bits and watching carefully what happens on
each internal iteration as the encryption proceeds. In many cases, some bit pat-
terns are more common than others, which can lead to probabilistic attacks.
The second development worth noting is linear cryptanalysis (Matsui, 1994).
It can break DES with only 243 known plaintexts. It works by XORing certain
bits in the plaintext and ciphertext together and examining the result. When done
repeatedly, half the bits should be 0s and half should be 1s. Often, however,
ciphers introduce a bias in one direction or the other, and this bias, however small,
can be exploited to reduce the work factor. For the details, see Matsui’s paper.
The third development is using analysis of electrical power consumption to
find secret keys. Computers typically use around 3 volts to represent a 1 bit and 0
volts to represent a 0 bit. Thus, processing a 1 takes more electrical energy than
processing a 0. If a cryptographic algorithm consists of a loop in which the key
bits are processed in order, an attacker who replaces the main n-GHz clock with a
slow (e.g., 100-Hz) clock and puts alligator clips on the CPU’s power and ground
pins can precisely monitor the power consumed by each machine instruction.
From this data, deducing the key is surprisingly easy. This kind of cryptanalysis
can be defeated only by carefully coding the algorithm in assembly language to
make sure power consumption is independent of the key and also independent of
all the individual round keys.
The fourth development is timing analysis. Cryptographic algorithms are full
of if statements that test bits in the round keys. If the then and else parts take dif-
ferent amounts of time, by slowing down the clock and seeing how long various
steps take, it may also be possible to deduce the round keys. Once all the round
keys are known, the original key can usually be computed. Power and timing
analysis can also be employed simultaneously to make the job easier. While pow-
er and timing analysis may seem exotic, in reality they are powerful techniques
that can break any cipher not specifically designed to resist them.
8.3 PUBLIC-KEY ALGORITHMS
Historically, distributing the keys has always been the weakest link in most
cryptosystems. No matter how strong a cryptosystem was, if an intruder could
steal the key, the system was worthless. Cryptologists always took for granted
that the encryption key and decryption key were the same (or easily derived from
one another). But the key had to be distributed to all users of the system. Thus, it
seemed as if there was an inherent problem. Keys had to be protected from theft,
but they also had to be distributed, so they could not be locked in a bank vault.
In 1976, two researchers at Stanford University, Diffie and Hellman (1976),
proposed a radically new kind of cryptosystem, one in which the encryption and
decryption keys were so different that the decryption key could not feasibly be

derived from the encryption key. In their proposal, the (keyed) encryption algo-
rithm, E, and the (keyed) decryption algorithm, D, had to meet three requirements.
These requirements can be stated simply as follows:
1. D(E(P)) = P.
2. It is exceedingly difficult to deduce D from E.
3. E cannot be broken by a chosen plaintext attack.
The first requirement says that if we apply D to an encrypted message, E(P), we
get the original plaintext message, P, back. Without this property, the legitimate
receiver could not decrypt the ciphertext. The second requirement speaks for it-
self. The third requirement is needed because, as we shall see in a moment, in-
truders may experiment with the algorithm to their hearts’ content. Under these
conditions, there is no reason that the encryption key cannot be made public.
The method works like this. A person, say, Alice, who wants to receive secret
messages, first devises two algorithms meeting the above requirements. The en-
cryption algorithm and Alice’s key are then made public, hence the name public-
key cryptography. Alice might put her public key on her home page on the
Web, for example. We will use the notation EA to mean the encryption algorithm
parameterized by Alice’s public key. Similarly, the (secret) decryption algorithm
parameterized by Alice’s private key is DA. Bob does the same thing, publicizing
EB but keeping DB secret.
Now let us see if we can solve the problem of establishing a secure channel
between Alice and Bob, who have never had any previous contact. Both Alice’s
encryption key, EA, and Bob’s encryption key, EB, are assumed to be in publicly
readable files. Now Alice takes her first message, P, computes EB(P), and sends
it to Bob. Bob then decrypts it by applying his secret key DB [i.e., he computes
DB(EB(P)) = P]. No one else can read the encrypted message, EB(P), because
the encryption system is assumed to be strong and because it is too difficult to
derive DB from the publicly known EB. To send a reply, R, Bob transmits EA(R).
Alice and Bob can now communicate securely.
A note on terminology is perhaps useful here. Public-key cryptography re-
quires each user to have two keys: a public key, used by the entire world for en-
crypting messages to be sent to that user, and a private key, which the user needs
for decrypting messages. We will consistently refer to these keys as the public
and private keys, respectively, and distinguish them from the secret keys used for
conventional symmetric-key cryptography.
8.3.1 RSA
The only catch is that we need to find algorithms that indeed satisfy all three
requirements. Due to the potential advantages of public-key cryptography, many
researchers are hard at work, and some algorithms have already been published.

One good method was discovered by a group at M.I.T. (Rivest et al., 1978). It is
known by the initials of the three discoverers (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman): RSA. It
has survived all attempts to break it for more than 30 years and is considered very
strong. Much practical security is based on it. For this reason, Rivest, Shamir,
and Adleman were given the 2002 ACM Turing Award. Its major disadvantage is
that it requires keys of at least 1024 bits for good security (versus 128 bits for
symmetric-key algorithms), which makes it quite slow.
The RSA method is based on some principles from number theory. We will
now summarize how to use the method; for details, consult the paper.
1. Choose two large primes, p and q (typically 1024 bits).
2. Compute n = p × q and z = (p −1) × (q −1).
3. Choose a number relatively prime to z and call it d.
4. Find e such that e × d = 1 mod z.
With these parameters computed in advance, we are ready to begin encryption.
Divide the plaintext (regarded as a bit string) into blocks, so that each plaintext
message, P, falls in the interval 0 ≤P < n. Do that by grouping the plaintext into
blocks of k bits, where k is the largest integer for which 2k < n is true.
To encrypt a message, P, compute C = P e (mod n). To decrypt C, compute
P = C d (mod n). It can be proven that for all P in the specified range, the en-
cryption and decryption functions are inverses. To perform the encryption, you
need e and n. To perform the decryption, you need d and n. Therefore, the public
key consists of the pair (e, n) and the private key consists of (d, n).
The security of the method is based on the difficulty of factoring large num-
bers. If the cryptanalyst could factor the (publicly known) n, he could then find p
and q, and from these z. Equipped with knowledge of z and e, d can be found
using Euclid’s algorithm. Fortunately, mathematicians have been trying to factor
large numbers for at least 300 years, and the accumulated evidence suggests that it
is an exceedingly difficult problem.
According to Rivest and colleagues, factoring a 500-digit number would re-
quire 1025 years using brute force. In both cases, they assumed the best known al-
gorithm and a computer with a 1-μsec instruction time. With a million chips run-
ning in parallel, each with an instruction time of 1 nsec, it would still take 1016
years. Even if computers continue to get faster by an order of magnitude per
decade, it will be many years before factoring a 500-digit number becomes feasi-
ble, at which time our descendants can simply choose p and q still larger.
A trivial pedagogical example of how the RSA algorithm works is given in
Fig. 8-17. For this example, we have chosen p = 3 and q = 11, giving n = 33 and
z = 20. A suitable value for d is d = 7, since 7 and 20 have no common factors.
With these choices, e can be found by solving the equation 7e = 1 (mod 20),
which yields e = 3. The ciphertext, C, corresponding to a plaintext message, P, is

ing use of the rule P = C 7 (mod 33). The figure shows the encryption of the

Figure 8-17. An example of the RSA algorithm.
Because the primes chosen for this example are so small, P must be less than
33, so each plaintext block can contain only a single character. The result is a
monoalphabetic substitution cipher, not very impressive. If instead we had cho-
sen p and q ∼∼2512, we would have n ∼∼21024, so each block could be up to 1024
bits or 128 eight-bit characters, versus 8 characters for DES and 16 characters for
AES.
It should be pointed out that using RSA as we have described is similar to
using a symmetric algorithm in ECB mode—the same input block gives the same
output block. Therefore, some form of chaining is needed for data encryption.
However, in practice, most RSA-based systems use public-key cryptography pri-
marily for distributing one-time session keys for use with some symmetric-key al-
gorithm such as AES or triple DES. RSA is too slow for actually encrypting large
volumes of data but is widely used for key distribution.
8.3.2 Other Public-Key Algorithms
Although RSA is widely used, it is by no means the only public-key algorithm
known. The first public-key algorithm was the knapsack algorithm (Merkle and
Hellman, 1978). The idea here is that someone owns a large number of objects,
each with a different weight. The owner encodes the message by secretly select-
ing a subset of the objects and placing them in the knapsack. The total weight of
the objects in the knapsack is made public, as is the list of all possible objects and
their corresponding weights. The list of objects in the knapsack is kept secret.
With certain additional restrictions, the problem of figuring out a possible list of
objects with the given weight was thought to be computationally infeasible and
formed the basis of the public-key algorithm.

The algorithm’s inventor, Ralph Merkle, was quite sure that this algorithm
could not be broken, so he offered a $100 reward to anyone who could break it.
Adi Shamir (the ‘‘S’’ in RSA) promptly broke it and collected the reward.
Undeterred, Merkle strengthened the algorithm and offered a $1000 reward to
anyone who could break the new one. Ronald Rivest (the ‘‘R’’ in RSA) promptly
broke the new one and collected the reward. Merkle did not dare offer $10,000
for the next version, so ‘‘A’’ (Leonard Adleman) was out of luck. Nevertheless,
the knapsack algorithm is not considered secure and is not used in practice any
more.
Other public-key schemes are based on the difficulty of computing discrete
logarithms. Algorithms that use this principle have been invented by El Gamal
(1985) and Schnorr (1991).
A few other schemes exist, such as those based on elliptic curves (Menezes
and Vanstone, 1993), but the two major categories are those based on the diffi-
culty of factoring large numbers and computing discrete logarithms modulo a
large prime. These problems are thought to be genuinely difficult to solve—
mathematicians have been working on them for many years without any great
breakthroughs.
8.4 DIGITAL SIGNATURES
The authenticity of many legal, financial, and other documents is determined
by the presence or absence of an authorized handwritten signature.
And
photocopies do not count. For computerized message systems to replace the
physical transport of paper-and-ink documents, a method must be found to allow
documents to be signed in an unforgeable way.
The problem of devising a replacement for handwritten signatures is a diffi-
cult one. Basically, what is needed is a system by which one party can send a
signed message to another party in such a way that the following conditions hold:
1. The receiver can verify the claimed identity of the sender.
2. The sender cannot later repudiate the contents of the message.
3. The receiver cannot possibly have concocted the message himself.
The first requirement is needed, for example, in financial systems.
When a
customer’s computer orders a bank’s computer to buy a ton of gold, the bank’s
computer needs to be able to make sure that the computer giving the order really
belongs to the customer whose account is to be debited. In other words, the bank
has to authenticate the customer (and the customer has to authenticate the bank).
The second requirement is needed to protect the bank against fraud. Suppose
that the bank buys the ton of gold, and immediately thereafter the price of gold

---

## Page 36

CHAP. 8
drops sharply. A dishonest customer might then proceed to sue the bank, claiming
that he never issued any order to buy gold. When the bank produces the message
in court, the customer may deny having sent it. The property that no party to a
contract can later deny having signed it is called nonrepudiation. The digital sig-
nature schemes that we will now study help provide it.
The third requirement is needed to protect the customer in the event that the
price of gold shoots up and the bank tries to construct a signed message in which
the customer asked for one bar of gold instead of one ton. In this fraud scenario,
the bank just keeps the rest of the gold for itself.
8.4.1 Symmetric-Key Signatures
One approach to digital signatures is to have a central authority that knows
everything and whom everyone trusts, say, Big Brother (BB). Each user then
chooses a secret key and carries it by hand to BB’s office. Thus, only Alice and
BB know Alice’s secret key, KA, and so on.
When Alice wants to send a signed plaintext message, P, to her banker, Bob,
she generates KA(B, RA, t, P), where B is Bob’s identity, RA is a random number
chosen by Alice, t is a timestamp to ensure freshness, and KA(B, RA, t, P) is the
message encrypted with her key, KA. Then she sends it as depicted in Fig. 8-18.
BB sees that the message is from Alice, decrypts it, and sends a message to Bob as
shown. The message to Bob contains the plaintext of Alice’s message and also
the signed message KBB(A, t, P). Bob now carries out Alice’s request.

Figure 8-18. Digital signatures with Big Brother.
What happens if Alice later denies sending the message? Step 1 is that every-
one sues everyone (at least, in the United States). Finally, when the case comes to
court and Alice vigorously denies sending Bob the disputed message, the judge
will ask Bob how he can be sure that the disputed message came from Alice and
not from Trudy. Bob first points out that BB will not accept a message from Alice
unless it is encrypted with KA, so there is no possibility of Trudy sending BB a
false message from Alice without BB detecting it immediately.
Bob then dramatically produces Exhibit A: KBB(A, t, P). Bob says that this is
a message signed by BB that proves Alice sent P to Bob. The judge then asks BB
(whom everyone trusts) to decrypt Exhibit A. When BB testifies that Bob is tel-
ling the truth, the judge decides in favor of Bob. Case dismissed.

One potential problem with the signature protocol of Fig. 8-18 is Trudy re-
playing either message. To minimize this problem, timestamps are used through-
out. Furthermore, Bob can check all recent messages to see if RA was used in any
of them. If so, the message is discarded as a replay. Note that based on the time-
stamp, Bob will reject very old messages. To guard against instant replay attacks,
Bob just checks the RA of every incoming message to see if such a message has
been received from Alice in the past hour. If not, Bob can safely assume this is a
new request.
8.4.2 Public-Key Signatures
A structural problem with using symmetric-key cryptography for digital sig-
natures is that everyone has to agree to trust Big Brother. Furthermore, Big
Brother gets to read all signed messages. The most logical candidates for running
the Big Brother server are the government, the banks, the accountants, and the
lawyers. Unfortunately, none of these inspire total confidence in all citizens.
Hence, it would be nice if signing documents did not require a trusted authority.
Fortunately, public-key cryptography can make an important contribution in
this area. Let us assume that the public-key encryption and decryption algorithms
have the property that E(D(P)) = P, in addition, of course, to the usual property
that D(E(P)) = P.
(RSA has this property, so the assumption is not unrea-
sonable.) Assuming that this is the case, Alice can send a signed plaintext mes-
sage, P, to Bob by transmitting EB(DA(P)). Note carefully that Alice knows her
own (private) key, DA, as well as Bob’s public key, EB, so constructing this mes-
sage is something Alice can do.
When Bob receives the message, he transforms it using his private key, as
usual, yielding DA(P), as shown in Fig. 8-19. He stores this text in a safe place
and then applies EA to get the original plaintext.

To see how the signature property works, suppose that Alice subsequently
denies having sent the message P to Bob. When the case comes up in court, Bob
can produce both P and DA(P). The judge can easily verify that Bob indeed has a
valid message encrypted by DA by simply applying EA to it. Since Bob does not

NETWORK SECURITY
CHAP. 8
know what Alice’s private key is, the only way Bob could have acquired a mes-
sage encrypted by it is if Alice did indeed send it. While in jail for perjury and
fraud, Alice will have much time to devise interesting new public-key algorithms.
Although using public-key cryptography for digital signatures is an elegant
scheme, there are problems that are related to the environment in which they oper-
ate rather than to the basic algorithm. For one thing, Bob can prove that a mes-
sage was sent by Alice only as long as DA remains secret. If Alice discloses her
secret key, the argument no longer holds, because anyone could have sent the
message, including Bob himself.
The problem might arise, for example, if Bob is Alice’s stockbroker. Suppose
that Alice tells Bob to buy a certain stock or bond. Immediately thereafter, the
price drops sharply. To repudiate her message to Bob, Alice runs to the police
claiming that her home was burglarized and the PC holding her key was stolen.
Depending on the laws in her state or country, she may or may not be legally
liable, especially if she claims not to have discovered the break-in until getting
home from work, several hours after it allegedly happened.
Another problem with the signature scheme is what happens if Alice decides
to change her key. Doing so is clearly legal, and it is probably a good idea to do
so periodically. If a court case later arises, as described above, the judge will
apply the current EA to DA(P) and discover that it does not produce P. Bob will
look pretty stupid at this point.
In principle, any public-key algorithm can be used for digital signatures. The
de facto industry standard is the RSA algorithm. Many security products use it.
However, in 1991, NIST proposed using a variant of the El Gamal public-key al-
gorithm for its new Digital Signature Standard (DSS). El Gamal gets its securi-
ty from the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms, rather than from the diffi-
culty of factoring large numbers.
As usual when the government tries to dictate cryptographic standards, there
was an uproar. DSS was criticized for being
1. Too secret (NSA designed the protocol for using El Gamal).
2. Too slow (10 to 40 times slower than RSA for checking signatures).
3. Too new (El Gamal had not yet been thoroughly analyzed).
4. Too insecure (fixed 512-bit key).
In a subsequent revision, the fourth point was rendered moot when keys up to
1024 bits were allowed. Nevertheless, the first two points remain valid.
8.4.3 Message Digests
One criticism of signature methods is that they often couple two distinct func-
tions: authentication and secrecy. Often, authentication is needed but secrecy is
not always needed. Also, getting an export license is often easier if the system in

---

## Page 39

SEC. 8.4
DIGITAL SIGNATURES
801
question provides only authentication but not secrecy. Below we will describe an
authentication scheme that does not require encrypting the entire message.
This scheme is based on the idea of a one-way hash function that takes an
arbitrarily long piece of plaintext and from it computes a fixed-length bit string.
This hash function, MD, often called a message digest, has four important proper-
ties:
1. Given P, it is easy to compute MD(P).
2. Given MD(P), it is effectively impossible to find P.
3. Given P, no one can find P′ such that MD (P′) = MD(P).
4. A change to the input of even 1 bit produces a very different output.
To meet criterion 3, the hash should be at least 128 bits long, preferably more. To
meet criterion 4, the hash must mangle the bits very thoroughly, not unlike the
symmetric-key encryption algorithms we have seen.
Computing a message digest from a piece of plaintext is much faster than en-
crypting that plaintext with a public-key algorithm, so message digests can be
used to speed up digital signature algorithms. To see how this works, consider the
signature protocol of Fig. 8-18 again. Instead, of signing P with KBB(A, t, P), BB
now computes the message digest by applying MD to P, yielding MD(P). BB
then encloses KBB(A, t, MD(P)) as the fifth item in the list encrypted with KB that
is sent to Bob, instead of KBB(A, t, P).
If a dispute arises, Bob can produce both P and KBB(A, t, MD(P)). After Big
Brother has decrypted it for the judge, Bob has MD(P), which is guaranteed to be
genuine, and the alleged P. However, since it is effectively impossible for Bob to
find any other message that gives this hash, the judge will easily be convinced that
Bob is telling the truth. Using message digests in this way saves both encryption
time and message transport costs.
Message digests work in public-key cryptosystems, too, as shown in Fig. 8-
20. Here, Alice first computes the message digest of her plaintext. She then signs
the message digest and sends both the signed digest and the plaintext to Bob. If
Trudy replaces P along the way, Bob will see this when he computes MD(P).

SHA-1 and SHA-2
A variety of message digest functions have been proposed. One of the most
widely used functions is SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) (NIST, 1993). Like
all message digests, it operates by mangling bits in a sufficiently complicated way
that every output bit is affected by every input bit. SHA-1 was developed by NSA
and blessed by NIST in FIPS 180-1. It processes input data in 512-bit blocks, and
it generates a 160-bit message digest. A typical way for Alice to send a nonsecret
but signed message to Bob is illustrated in Fig. 8-21. Here, her plaintext message
is fed into the SHA-1 algorithm to get a 160-bit SHA-1 hash. Alice then signs the
hash with her RSA private key and sends both the plaintext message and the
signed hash to Bob.

After receiving the message, Bob computes the SHA-1 hash himself and also
applies Alice’s public key to the signed hash to get the original hash, H. If the
two agree, the message is considered valid. Since there is no way for Trudy to
modify the (plaintext) message while it is in transit and produce a new one that
hashes to H, Bob can easily detect any changes Trudy has made to the message.
For messages whose integrity is important but whose contents are not secret, the
scheme of Fig. 8-21 is widely used. For a relatively small cost in computation, it
guarantees that any modifications made to the plaintext message in transit can be
detected with very high probability.
Now let us briefly see how SHA-1 works. It starts out by padding the mes-
sage by adding a 1 bit to the end, followed by as many 0 bits as are necessary, but
at least 64, to make the length a multiple of 512 bits. Then a 64-bit number con-
taining the message length before padding is ORed into the low-order 64 bits. In
Fig. 8-22, the message is shown with padding on the right because English text
and figures go from left to right (i.e., the lower right is generally perceived as the
end of the figure). With computers, this orientation corresponds to big-endian
machines such as the SPARC and the IBM 360 and its successors, but SHA-1 al-
ways pads the end of the message, no matter which endian machine is used.

During the computation, SHA-1 maintains five 32-bit variables, H 0 through
H 4, where the hash accumulates. These are shown in Fig. 8-22(b). They are ini-
tialized to constants specified in the standard.
Each of the blocks M 0 through Mn −1 is now processed in turn. For the cur-
rent block, the 16 words are first copied into the start of an auxiliary 80-word
array, W, as shown in Fig. 8-22(c). Then the other 64 words in W are filled in
using the formula
Wi = S 1(Wi −3 XOR Wi −8 XOR Wi −14 XOR Wi −16)
(16 ≤i ≤79)
where S b(W) represents the left circular rotation of the 32-bit word, W, by b bits.
Now five scratch variables, A through E, are initialized from H 0 through H 4, re-
spectively.
The actual calculation can be expressed in pseudo-C as
for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
temp = S5(A) + fi (B, C, D) + E + Wi + Ki;
E = D; D = C; C = S30(B); B = A; A = temp;
}
where the Ki constants are defined in the standard. The mixing functions fi are
defined as
fi (B,C,D) = (B AND C) OR (NOT B AND D)
( 0 ≤i ≤19)
fi (B,C,D) = B XOR C XOR D
(20 ≤i ≤39)
fi (B,C,D) = (B AND C) OR (B AND D) OR (C AND D)
(40 ≤i ≤59)
fi (B,C,D) = B XOR C XOR D
(60 ≤i ≤79)
When all 80 iterations of the loop are completed, A through E are added to H 0
through H 4, respectively.
Now that the first 512-bit block has been processed, the next one is started.
The W array is reinitialized from the new block, but H is left as it was. When this

---

CHAP. 8
block is finished, the next one is started, and so on, until all the 512-bit message
blocks have been tossed into the soup. When the last block has been finished, the
five 32-bit words in the H array are output as the 160-bit cryptographic hash. The
complete C code for SHA-1 is given in RFC 3174.
New versions of SHA-1 have been developed that produce hashes of 224,
256, 384, and 512 bits. Collectively, these versions are called SHA-2. Not only
are these hashes longer than SHA-1 hashes, but the digest function has been
changed to combat some potential weaknesses of SHA-1. SHA-2 is not yet widely
used, but it is likely to be in the future.
MD5
For completeness, we will mention another digest that is popular. MD5
(Rivest, 1992) is the fifth in a series of message digests designed by Ronald
Rivest. Very briefly, the message is padded to a length of 448 bits (modulo 512).
Then the original length of the message is appended as a 64-bit integer to give a
total input whose length is a multiple of 512 bits. Each round of the computation
takes a 512-bit block of input and mixes it thoroughly with a running 128-bit buff-
er. For good measure, the mixing uses a table constructed from the sine function.
The point of using a known function is to avoid any suspicion that the designer
built in a clever back door through which only he can enter. This process con-
tinues until all the input blocks have been consumed. The contents of the 128-bit
buffer form the message digest.
After more than a decade of solid use and study, weaknesses in MD5 have led
to the ability to find collisions, or different messages with the same hash (Sotirov,
et al., 2008). This is the death knell for a digest function because it means that the
digest cannot safely be used to represent a message. Thus, the security commun-
ity considers MD5 to be broken; it should be replaced where possible and no new
systems should use it as part of their design. Nevertheless, you may still see MD5
used in existing systems.
8.4.4 The Birthday Attack
In the world of crypto, nothing is ever what it seems to be. One might think
that it would take on the order of 2m operations to subvert an m-bit message dig-
est. In fact, 2m/2 operations will often do using the birthday attack, an approach
published by Yuval (1979) in his now-classic paper ‘‘How to Swindle Rabin.’’
The idea for this attack comes from a technique that math professors often use
in their probability courses. The question is: how many students do you need in a
class before the probability of having two people with the same birthday exceeds
1/2? Most students expect the answer to be way over 100. In fact, probability
theory says it is just 23. Without giving a rigorous analysis, intuitively, with 23

805
people, we can form (23 × 22)/2 = 253 different pairs, each of which has a
probability of 1/365 of being a hit. In this light, it is not really so surprising any
more.
More generally, if there is some mapping between inputs and outputs with n
inputs (people, messages, etc.) and k possible outputs (birthdays, message digests,
etc.), there are n(n −1)/2 input pairs. If n(n −1)/2 > k, the chance of having at
least one match is pretty good. Thus, approximately, a match is likely for n > √k.
This result means that a 64-bit message digest can probably be broken by generat-
ing about 232 messages and looking for two with the same message digest.
Let us look at a practical example. The Department of Computer Science at
State University has one position for a tenured faculty member and two candi-
dates, Tom and Dick. Tom was hired two years before Dick, so he goes up for
review first. If he gets it, Dick is out of luck. Tom knows that the department
chairperson, Marilyn, thinks highly of his work, so he asks her to write him a
letter of recommendation to the Dean, who will decide on Tom’s case. Once sent,
all letters become confidential.
Marilyn tells her secretary, Ellen, to write the Dean a letter, outlining what
she wants in it. When it is ready, Marilyn will review it, compute and sign the
64-bit digest, and send it to the Dean. Ellen can send the letter later by email.
Unfortunately for Tom, Ellen is romantically involved with Dick and would
like to do Tom in, so she writes the following letter with the 32 bracketed options:
Dear Dean Smith,
This [letter | message] is to give my [honest | frank] opinion of Prof. Tom

ample] your State 2000 program. Without these funds we would [be unable | not

I strongly urge you to grant him tenure.
Unfortunately for Tom, as soon as Ellen finishes composing and typing in this
letter, she also writes a second one:

Dear Dean Smith,
This [letter | message] is to give my [honest | frank] opinion of Prof. Tom
Wilson, who is [a candidate | up] for tenure [now | this year]. I have [known |
worked with] Tom for [about | almost] six years. He is a [poor | weak] researcher
not well known in his [field | area]. His research [hardly ever | rarely] shows

ment’s] least popular [teacher | instructor], known [mostly | primarily] within [the

[In addition | Additionally] Tom is a [poor | marginal] fund raiser. His [grants

may have to cancel some essential programs, such as your State 2000 program.
Unfortunately, under these [conditions | circumstances] I cannot in good [consci-

Now Ellen programs her computer to compute the 232 message digests of each
letter overnight. Chances are, one digest of the first letter will match one digest of
the second. If not, she can add a few more options and try again tonight. Suppose
that she finds a match. Call the ‘‘good’’ letter A and the ‘‘bad’’ one B.
Ellen now emails letter A to Marilyn for approval. Letter B she keeps secret,
showing it to no one. Marilyn, of course, approves it, computes her 64-bit mes-
sage digest, signs the digest, and emails the signed digest off to Dean Smith. In-
dependently, Ellen emails letter B to the Dean (not letter A, as she is supposed to).
After getting the letter and signed message digest, the Dean runs the message
digest algorithm on letter B, sees that it agrees with what Marilyn sent him, and

with the same message digest and sent her a different one than the one Marilyn

appalled and breaks off the affair. Ellen is furious and confesses to Marilyn.
Marilyn calls the Dean. Tom gets tenure after all.) With SHA-1, the birthday at-
tack is difficult because even at the ridiculous speed of 1 trillion digests per sec-
ond, it would take over 32,000 years to compute all 280 digests of two letters with
80 variants each, and even then a match is not guaranteed. With a cloud of
1,000,000 chips working in parallel, 32,000 years becomes 2 weeks.
8.5 MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC KEYS
Public-key cryptography makes it possible for people who do not share a
common key in advance to nevertheless communicate securely. It also makes
signing messages possible without the presence of a trusted third party. Finally,

signed message digests make it possible for the recipient to verify the integrity of
received messages easily and securely.
However, there is one problem that we have glossed over a bit too quickly: if
Alice and Bob do not know each other, how do they get each other’s public keys
to start the communication process? The obvious solution—put your public key
on your Web site—does not work, for the following reason. Suppose that Alice
wants to look up Bob’s public key on his Web site. How does she do it? She
starts by typing in Bob’s URL. Her browser then looks up the DNS address of
Bob’s home page and sends it a GET request, as shown in Fig. 8-23. Unfortunate-
ly, Trudy intercepts the request and replies with a fake home page, probably a
copy of Bob’s home page except for the replacement of Bob’s public key with
Trudy’s public key. When Alice now encrypts her first message with ET, Trudy
decrypts it, reads it, re-encrypts it with Bob’s public key, and sends it to Bob, who
is none the wiser that Trudy is reading his incoming messages. Worse yet, Trudy
could modify the messages before reencrypting them for Bob. Clearly, some
mechanism is needed to make sure that public keys can be exchanged securely.

8.5.1 Certificates
As a first attempt at distributing public keys securely, we could imagine a
KDC key distribution center available online 24 hours a day to provide public
keys on demand. One of the many problems with this solution is that it is not
scalable, and the key distribution center would rapidly become a bottleneck.
Also, if it ever went down, Internet security would suddenly grind to a halt.
For these reasons, people have developed a different solution, one that does
not require the key distribution center to be online all the time. In fact, it does not
have to be online at all. Instead, what it does is certify the public keys belonging
to people, companies, and other organizations. An organization that certifies pub-
lic keys is now called a CA (Certification Authority).
As an example, suppose that Bob wants to allow Alice and other people he
does not know to communicate with him securely. He can go to the CA with his
public key along with his passport or driver’s license and ask to be certified. The
CA then issues a certificate similar to the one in Fig. 8-24 and signs its SHA-1

hash with the CA’s private key. Bob then pays the CA’s fee and gets a CD-ROM
containing the certificate and its signed hash.

SHA-1 hash of the above certificate signed with the CA’s private key
Figure 8-24. A possible certificate and its signed hash.
The fundamental job of a certificate is to bind a public key to the name of a
principal (individual, company, etc.). Certificates themselves are not secret or
protected. Bob might, for example, decide to put his new certificate on his Web
site, with a link on the main page saying: Click here for my public-key certificate.
The resulting click would return both the certificate and the signature block (the
signed SHA-1 hash of the certificate).
Now let us run through the scenario of Fig. 8-23 again. When Trudy inter-
cepts Alice’s request for Bob’s home page, what can she do? She can put her own
certificate and signature block on the fake page, but when Alice reads the contents
of the certificate she will immediately see that she is not talking to Bob because
Bob’s name is not in it. Trudy can modify Bob’s home page on the fly, replacing
Bob’s public key with her own. However, when Alice runs the SHA-1 algorithm
on the certificate, she will get a hash that does not agree with the one she gets
when she applies the CA’s well-known public key to the signature block. Since
Trudy does not have the CA’s private key, she has no way of generating a signa-
ture block that contains the hash of the modified Web page with her public key on
it. In this way, Alice can be sure she has Bob’s public key and not Trudy’s or
someone else’s. And as we promised, this scheme does not require the CA to be
online for verification, thus eliminating a potential bottleneck.
While the standard function of a certificate is to bind a public key to a princi-
pal, a certificate can also be used to bind a public key to an attribute. For ex-
ample, a certificate could say: ‘‘This public key belongs to someone over 18.’’ It
could be used to prove that the owner of the private key was not a minor and thus
allowed to access material not suitable for children, and so on, but without dis-
closing the owner’s identity. Typically, the person holding the certificate would
send it to the Web site, principal, or process that cared about age. That site, prin-
cipal, or process would then generate a random number and encrypt it with the
public key in the certificate. If the owner were able to decrypt it and send it back,

809
that would be proof that the owner indeed had the attribute stated in the certifi-
cate. Alternatively, the random number could be used to generate a session key
for the ensuing conversation.
Another example of where a certificate might contain an attribute is in an ob-
ject-oriented distributed system. Each object normally has multiple methods. The
owner of the object could provide each customer with a certificate giving a bit
map of which methods the customer is allowed to invoke and binding the bit map
to a public key using a signed certificate. Again, if the certificate holder can
prove possession of the corresponding private key, he will be allowed to perform
the methods in the bit map. This approach has the property that the owner’s iden-
tity need not be known, a property useful in situations where privacy is important.
8.5.2 X.509
If everybody who wanted something signed went to the CA with a different
kind of certificate, managing all the different formats would soon become a prob-
lem. To solve this problem, a standard for certificates has been devised and
approved by ITU. The standard is called X.509 and is in widespread use on the
Internet. It has gone through three versions since the initial standardization in
1988. We will discuss V3.
X.509 has been heavily influenced by the OSI world, borrowing some of its
worst features (e.g., naming and encoding). Surprisingly, IETF went along with
X.509, even though in nearly every other area, from machine addresses to tran-
sport protocols to email formats, IETF generally ignored OSI and tried to do it
right. The IETF version of X.509 is described in RFC 5280.
At its core, X.509 is a way to describe certificates. The primary fields in a
certificate are listed in Fig. 8-25. The descriptions given there should provide a
general idea of what the fields do. For additional information, please consult the
standard itself or RFC 2459.
For example, if Bob works in the loan department of the Money Bank, his
X.500 address might be
/C=US/O=MoneyBank/OU=Loan/CN=Bob/
where C is for country, O is for organization, OU is for organizational unit, and
CN is for common name. CAs and other entities are named in a similar way. A
substantial problem with X.500 names is that if Alice is trying to contact
bob@moneybank.com and is given a certificate with an X.500 name, it may not be
obvious to her that the certificate refers to the Bob she wants. Fortunately, start-
ing with version 3, DNS names are now permitted instead of X.500 names, so this
problem may eventually vanish.
Certificates are encoded using OSI ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation 1),
which is sort of like a struct in C, except with a extremely peculiar and verbose
notation. More information about X.509 is given by Ford and Baum (2000).

8.5.3 Public Key Infrastructures
Having a single CA to issue all the world’s certificates obviously would not
work. It would collapse under the load and be a central point of failure as well. A
possible solution might be to have multiple CAs, all run by the same organization
and all using the same private key to sign certificates. While this would solve the
load and failure problems, it introduces a new problem: key leakage. If there
were dozens of servers spread around the world, all holding the CA’s private key,
the chance of the private key being stolen or otherwise leaking out would be
greatly increased. Since the compromise of this key would ruin the world’s elec-
tronic security infrastructure, having a single central CA is very risky.
In addition, which organization would operate the CA? It is hard to imagine
any authority that would be accepted worldwide as legitimate and trustworthy. In
some countries, people would insist that it be a government, while in other coun-
tries they would insist that it not be a government.
For these reasons, a different way for certifying public keys has evolved. It
goes under the general name of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). In this sec-
tion, we will summarize how it works in general, although there have been many
proposals, so the details will probably evolve in time.
A PKI has multiple components, including users, CAs, certificates, and direc-
tories. What the PKI does is provide a way of structuring these components and
define standards for the various documents and protocols. A particularly simple
form of PKI is a hierarchy of CAs, as depicted in Fig. 8-26. In this example we
have shown three levels, but in practice there might be fewer or more. The top-
level CA, the root, certifies second-level CAs, which we here call RAs (Regional

Authorities) because they might cover some geographic region, such as a country
or continent. This term is not standard, though; in fact, no term is really standard
for the different levels of the tree. These in turn certify the real CAs, which issue
the X.509 certificates to organizations and individuals. When the root authorizes
a new RA, it generates an X.509 certificate stating that it has approved the RA, in-
cludes the new RA’s public key in it, signs it, and hands it to the RA. Similarly,
when an RA approves a new CA, it produces and signs a certificate stating its
approval and containing the CA’s public key.

Figure 8-26. (a) A hierarchical PKI. (b) A chain of certificates.
Our PKI works like this. Suppose that Alice needs Bob’s public key in order
to communicate with him, so she looks for and finds a certificate containing it,
signed by CA 5. But Alice has never heard of CA 5. For all she knows, CA 5
might be Bob’s 10-year-old daughter. She could go to CA 5 and say: ‘‘Prove your
legitimacy.’’ CA 5 will respond with the certificate it got from RA 2, which con-
tains CA 5’s public key. Now armed with CA 5’s public key, she can verify that
Bob’s certificate was indeed signed by CA 5 and is thus legal.
Unless RA 2 is Bob’s 12-year-old son. So, the next step is for her to ask RA 2
to prove it is legitimate. The response to her query is a certificate signed by the
root and containing RA 2’s public key. Now Alice is sure she has Bob’s public key.
But how does Alice find the root’s public key? Magic. It is assumed that
everyone knows the root’s public key. For example, her browser might have been
shipped with the root’s public key built in.
Bob is a friendly sort of guy and does not want to cause Alice a lot of work.
He knows that she is going to have to check out CA 5 and RA 2, so to save her
some trouble, he collects the two needed certificates and gives her the two certifi-
cates along with his. Now she can use her own knowledge of the root’s public
key to verify the top-level certificate and the public key contained therein to ver-
ify the second one. Alice does not need to contact anyone to do the verification.

Because the certificates are all signed, she can easily detect any attempts to tam-
per with their contents. A chain of certificates going back to the root like this is
sometimes called a chain of trust or a certification path. The technique is wide-
ly used in practice.
Of course, we still have the problem of who is going to run the root. The
solution is not to have a single root, but to have many roots, each with its own
RAs and CAs. In fact, modern browsers come preloaded with the public keys for
over 100 roots, sometimes referred to as trust anchors. In this way, having a sin-
gle worldwide trusted authority can be avoided.
But there is now the issue of how the browser vendor decides which purported
trust anchors are reliable and which are sleazy. It all comes down to the user
trusting the browser vendor to make wise choices and not simply approve all trust
anchors willing to pay its inclusion fee. Most browsers allow users to inspect the
root keys (usually in the form of certificates signed by the root) and delete any
that seem shady.
Directories
Another issue for any PKI is where certificates (and their chains back to some
known trust anchor) are stored. One possibility is to have each user store his or
her own certificates. While doing this is safe (i.e., there is no way for users to
tamper with signed certificates without detection), it is also inconvenient. One al-
ternative that has been proposed is to use DNS as a certificate directory. Before
contacting Bob, Alice probably has to look up his IP address using DNS, so why
not have DNS return Bob’s entire certificate chain along with his IP address?
Some people think this is the way to go, but others would prefer dedicated di-
rectory servers whose only job is managing X.509 certificates. Such directories
could provide lookup services by using properties of the X.500 names. For ex-
ample, in theory such a directory service could answer a query such as: ‘‘Give me
a list of all people named Alice who work in sales departments anywhere in the
U.S. or Canada.’’
Revocation
The real world is full of certificates, too, such as passports and drivers’
licenses.
Sometimes these certificates can be revoked, for example, drivers’
licenses can be revoked for drunken driving and other driving offenses. The same
problem occurs in the digital world: the grantor of a certificate may decide to
revoke it because the person or organization holding it has abused it in some way.
It can also be revoked if the subject’s private key has been exposed or, worse yet,
the CA’s private key has been compromised. Thus, a PKI needs to deal with the
issue of revocation. The possibility of revocation complicates matters.

MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC KEYS
813
A first step in this direction is to have each CA periodically issue a CRL
(Certificate Revocation List) giving the serial numbers of all certificates that it
has revoked. Since certificates contain expiry times, the CRL need only contain
the serial numbers of certificates that have not yet expired. Once its expiry time
has passed, a certificate is automatically invalid, so no distinction is needed be-
tween those that just timed out and those that were actually revoked. In both
cases, they cannot be used any more.
Unfortunately, introducing CRLs means that a user who is about to use a cer-
tificate must now acquire the CRL to see if the certificate has been revoked. If it
has been, it should not be used. However, even if the certificate is not on the list,
it might have been revoked just after the list was published. Thus, the only way to
really be sure is to ask the CA. And on the next use of the same certificate, the
CA has to be asked again, since the certificate might have been revoked a few
seconds ago.
Another complication is that a revoked certificate could conceivably be rein-
stated, for example, if it was revoked for nonpayment of some fee that has since
been paid. Having to deal with revocation (and possibly reinstatement) eliminates
one of the best properties of certificates, namely, that they can be used without
having to contact a CA.
Where should CRLs be stored? A good place would be the same place the
certificates themselves are stored. One strategy is for the CA to actively push out
CRLs periodically and have the directories process them by simply removing the
revoked certificates. If directories are not used for storing certificates, the CRLs
can be cached at various places around the network. Since a CRL is itself a
signed document, if it is tampered with, that tampering can be easily detected.
If certificates have long lifetimes, the CRLs will be long, too. For example, if
credit cards are valid for 5 years, the number of revocations outstanding will be
much longer than if new cards are issued every 3 months. A standard way to deal
with long CRLs is to issue a master list infrequently, but issue updates to it more
often. Doing this reduces the bandwidth needed for distributing the CRLs.
8.6 COMMUNICATION SECURITY
We have now finished our study of the tools of the trade. Most of the impor-
tant techniques and protocols have been covered. The rest of the chapter is about
how these techniques are applied in practice to provide network security, plus
some thoughts about the social aspects of security at the end of the chapter.
In the following four sections, we will look at communication security, that is,
how to get the bits secretly and without modification from source to destination
and how to keep unwanted bits outside the door. These are by no means the only
security issues in networking, but they are certainly among the most important
ones, making this a good place to start our study.

CHAP. 8
8.6.1 IPsec
IETF has known for years that security was lacking in the Internet. Adding it
was not easy because a war broke out about where to put it. Most security experts
believe that to be really secure, encryption and integrity checks have to be end to
end (i.e., in the application layer). That is, the source process encrypts and/or in-
tegrity protects the data and sends them to the destination process where they are
decrypted and/or verified. Any tampering done in between these two processes,
including within either operating system, can then be detected. The trouble with
this approach is that it requires changing all the applications to make them securi-
ty aware. In this view, the next best approach is putting encryption in the tran-
sport layer or in a new layer between the application layer and the transport layer,
making it still end to end but not requiring applications to be changed.
The opposite view is that users do not understand security and will not be ca-
pable of using it correctly and nobody wants to modify existing programs in any
way, so the network layer should authenticate and/or encrypt packets without the
users being involved. After years of pitched battles, this view won enough sup-
port that a network layer security standard was defined. In part, the argument was
that having network layer encryption does not prevent security-aware users from
doing it right and it does help security-unaware users to some extent.
The result of this war was a design called IPsec (IP security), which is de-
scribed in RFCs 2401, 2402, and 2406, among others. Not all users want en-
cryption (because it is computationally expensive). Rather than make it optional,
it was decided to require encryption all the time but permit the use of a null algo-
rithm. The null algorithm is described and praised for its simplicity, ease of im-
plementation, and great speed in RFC 2410.
The complete IPsec design is a framework for multiple services, algorithms,
and granularities. The reason for multiple services is that not everyone wants to
pay the price for having all the services all the time, so the services are available a
la carte.
The major services are secrecy, data integrity, and protection from
replay attacks (where the intruder replays a conversation). All of these are based
on symmetric-key cryptography because high performance is crucial.
The reason for having multiple algorithms is that an algorithm that is now
thought to be secure may be broken in the future. By making IPsec algorithm-in-
dependent, the framework can survive even if some particular algorithm is later
broken.
The reason for having multiple granularities is to make it possible to protect a
single TCP connection, all traffic between a pair of hosts, or all traffic between a
pair of secure routers, among other possibilities.
One slightly surprising aspect of IPsec is that even though it is in the IP layer,
it is connection oriented. Actually, that is not so surprising because to have any
security, a key must be established and used for some period of time—in essence,
a kind of connection by a different name. Also, connections amortize the setup

costs over many packets. A ‘‘connection’’ in the context of IPsec is called an SA
(Security Association). An SA is a simplex connection between two endpoints
and has a security identifier associated with it. If secure traffic is needed in both
directions, two security associations are required. Security identifiers are carried
in packets traveling on these secure connections and are used to look up keys and
other relevant information when a secure packet arrives.
Technically, IPsec has two principal parts. The first part describes two new
headers that can be added to packets to carry the security identifier, integrity con-
trol data, and other information. The other part, ISAKMP (Internet Security
Association and Key Management Protocol), deals with establishing keys.
ISAKMP is a framework. The main protocol for carrying out the work is IKE
(Internet Key Exchange). Version 2 of IKE as described in RFC 4306 should be
used, as the earlier version was deeply flawed, as pointed out by Perlman and
Kaufman (2000).
IPsec can be used in either of two modes. In transport mode, the IPsec
header is inserted just after the IP header. The Protocol field in the IP header is
changed to indicate that an IPsec header follows the normal IP header (before the
TCP header). The IPsec header contains security information, primarily the SA
identifier, a new sequence number, and possibly an integrity check of the payload.
In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet, header and all, is encapsulated in the
body of a new IP packet with a completely new IP header. Tunnel mode is useful
when the tunnel ends at a location other than the final destination. In some cases,
the end of the tunnel is a security gateway machine, for example, a company fire-
wall. This is commonly the case for a VPN (Virtual Private Network). In this
mode, the security gateway encapsulates and decapsulates packets as they pass
through it. By terminating the tunnel at this secure machine, the machines on the
company LAN do not have to be aware of IPsec. Only the security gateway has
to know about it.
Tunnel mode is also useful when a bundle of TCP connections is aggregated
and handled as one encrypted stream because it prevents an intruder from seeing
who is sending how many packets to whom. Sometimes just knowing how much
traffic is going where is valuable information. For example, if during a military
crisis, the amount of traffic flowing between the Pentagon and the White House
were to drop sharply, but the amount of traffic between the Pentagon and some
military installation deep in the Colorado Rocky Mountains were to increase by
the same amount, an intruder might be able to deduce some useful information
from these data. Studying the flow patterns of packets, even if they are encrypted,
is called traffic analysis. Tunnel mode provides a way to foil it to some extent.
The disadvantage of tunnel mode is that it adds an extra IP header, thus increasing
packet size substantially. In contrast, transport mode does not affect packet size
as much.
The first new header is AH (Authentication Header). It provides integrity
checking and antireplay security, but not secrecy (i.e., no data encryption). The

---

use of AH in transport mode is illustrated in Fig. 8-27. In IPv4, it is interposed
between the IP header (including any options) and the TCP header. In IPv6, it is
just another extension header and is treated as such. In fact, the format is close to
that of a standard IPv6 extension header. The payload may have to be padded out
to some particular length for the authentication algorithm, as shown.

Figure 8-27. The IPsec authentication header in transport mode for IPv4.
Let us now examine the AH header. The Next header field is used to store the
value that the IP Protocol field had before it was replaced with 51 to indicate that
an AH header follows. In most cases, the code for TCP (6) will go here. The
Payload length is the number of 32-bit words in the AH header minus 2.
The Security parameters index is the connection identifier. It is inserted by
the sender to indicate a particular record in the receiver’s database. This record
contains the shared key used on this connection and other information about the
connection. If this protocol had been invented by ITU rather than IETF, this field
would have been called Virtual circuit number.
The Sequence number field is used to number all the packets sent on an SA.
Every packet gets a unique number, even retransmissions. In other words, the re-
transmission of a packet gets a different number here than the original (even
though its TCP sequence number is the same). The purpose of this field is to
detect replay attacks. These sequence numbers may not wrap around. If all 232
are exhausted, a new SA must be established to continue communication.
Finally, we come to Authentication data, which is a variable-length field that
contains the payload’s digital signature. When the SA is established, the two
sides negotiate which signature algorithm they are going to use. Normally, pub-
lic-key cryptography is not used here because packets must be processed extreme-
ly rapidly and all known public-key algorithms are too slow. Since IPsec is based
on symmetric-key cryptography and the sender and receiver negotiate a shared
key before setting up an SA, the shared key is used in the signature computation.
One simple way is to compute the hash over the packet plus the shared key. The
shared key is not transmitted, of course. A scheme like this is called an HMAC

(Hashed Message Authentication Code). It is much faster to compute than first
running SHA-1 and then running RSA on the result.
The AH header does not allow encryption of the data, so it is mostly useful
when integrity checking is needed but secrecy is not needed. One noteworthy fea-
ture of AH is that the integrity check covers some of the fields in the IP header,
namely, those that do not change as the packet moves from router to router. The
Time to live field changes on each hop, for example, so it cannot be included in
the integrity check. However, the IP source address is included in the check,
making it impossible for an intruder to falsify the origin of a packet.
The alternative IPsec header is ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload). Its
use for both transport mode and tunnel mode is shown in Fig. 8-28.

The ESP header consists of two 32-bit words. They are the Security parame-
ters index and Sequence number fields that we saw in AH. A third word that gen-
erally follows them (but is technically not part of the header) is the Initialization
vector used for the data encryption, unless null encryption is used, in which case it
is omitted.
ESP also provides for HMAC integrity checks, as does AH, but rather than
being included in the header, they come after the payload, as shown in Fig. 8-28.
Putting the HMAC at the end has an advantage in a hardware implementation: the
HMAC can be calculated as the bits are going out over the network interface and
appended to the end. This is why Ethernet and other LANs have their CRCs in a
trailer, rather than in a header. With AH, the packet has to be buffered and the
signature computed before the packet can be sent, potentially reducing the number
of packets/sec that can be sent.
Given that ESP can do everything AH can do and more and is more efficient
to boot, the question arises: why bother having AH at all? The answer is mostly
historical. Originally, AH handled only integrity and ESP handled only secrecy.
Later, integrity was added to ESP, but the people who designed AH did not want
to let it die after all that work. Their only real argument is that AH checks part of
the IP header, which ESP does not, but other than that it is really a weak argu-
ment. Another weak argument is that a product supporting AH but not ESP might

8.6.2 Firewalls
The ability to connect any computer, anywhere, to any other computer, any-
where, is a mixed blessing. For individuals at home, wandering around the Inter-
net is lots of fun. For corporate security managers, it is a nightmare. Most com-
panies have large amounts of confidential information online—trade secrets, prod-
uct development plans, marketing strategies, financial analyses, etc. Disclosure of
this information to a competitor could have dire consequences.
In addition to the danger of information leaking out, there is also a danger of
information leaking in. In particular, viruses, worms, and other digital pests can
breach security, destroy valuable data, and waste large amounts of administrators’
time trying to clean up the mess they leave. Often they are imported by careless
employees who want to play some nifty new game.
Consequently, mechanisms are needed to keep ‘‘good’’ bits in and ‘‘bad’’ bits
out. One method is to use IPsec. This approach protects data in transit between
secure sites. However, IPsec does nothing to keep digital pests and intruders from
getting onto the company LAN. To see how to accomplish this goal, we need to
look at firewalls.
Firewalls are just a modern adaptation of that old medieval security standby:
digging a deep moat around your castle. This design forced everyone entering or
leaving the castle to pass over a single drawbridge, where they could be inspected
by the I/O police. With networks, the same trick is possible: a company can have
many LANs connected in arbitrary ways, but all traffic to or from the company is
forced through an electronic drawbridge (firewall), as shown in Fig. 8-29. No
other route exists.

The firewall acts as a packet filter. It inspects each and every incoming and
outgoing packet. Packets meeting some criterion described in rules formulated by
the network administrator are forwarded normally. Those that fail the test are
uncermoniously dropped.
The filtering criterion is typically given as rules or tables that list sources and
destinations that are acceptable, sources and destinations that are blocked, and de-
fault rules about what to do with packets coming from or going to other machines.
In the common case of a TCP/IP setting, a source or destination might consist of
an IP address and a port. Ports indicate which service is desired. For example,
TCP port 25 is for mail, and TCP port 80 is for HTTP. Some ports can simply be
blocked. For example, a company could block incoming packets for all IP ad-
dresses combined with TCP port 79. It was once popular for the Finger service to
look up people’s email addresses but is little used today.
Other ports are not so easily blocked. The difficulty is that network adminis-
trators want security but cannot cut off communication with the outside world.
That arrangement would be much simpler and better for security, but there would
be no end to user complaints about it. This is where arrangements such as the
DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone) shown in Fig. 8-29 come in handy. The DMZ is the
part of the company network that lies outside of the security perimeter. Anything
goes here. By placing a machine such as a Web server in the DMZ, computers on
the Internet can contact it to browse the company Web site. Now the firewall can
be configured to block incoming TCP traffic to port 80 so that computers on the
Internet cannot use this port to attack computers on the internal network. To allow
the Web server to be managed, the firewall can have a rule to permit connections
between internal machines and the Web server.
Firewalls have become much more sophisticated over time in an arms race
with attackers. Originally, firewalls applied a rule set independently for each
packet, but it proved difficult to write rules that allowed useful functionality but
blocked all unwanted traffic. Stateful firewalls map packets to connections and
use TCP/IP header fields to keep track of connections. This allows for rules that,
for example, allow an external Web server to send packets to an internal host, but
only if the internal host first establishes a connection with the external Web ser-
ver. Such a rule is not possible with stateless designs that must either pass or drop
all packets from the external Web server.
Another level of sophistication up from stateful processing is for the firewall
to implement application-level gateways. This processing involves the firewall
looking inside packets, beyond even the TCP header, to see what the application
is doing. With this capability, it is possible to distinguish HTTP traffic used for
Web browsing from HTTP traffic used for peer-to-peer file sharing. Administra-
tors can write rules to spare the company from peer-to-peer file sharing but allow
Web browsing that is vital for business. For all of these methods, outgoing traffic
can be inspected as well as incoming traffic, for example, to prevent sensitive
documents from being emailed outside of the company.

CHAP. 8
As the above discussion should make clear, firewalls violate the standard lay-
ering of protocols. They are network layer devices, but they peek at the transport
and applications layers to do their filtering.
This makes them fragile. For
instance, firewalls tend to rely on standard port numbering conventions to deter-
mine what kind of traffic is carried in a packet. Standard ports are often used, but
not by all computers, and not by all applications either. Some peer-to-peer appli-
cations select ports dynamically to avoid being easily spotted (and blocked). En-
cryption with IPSEC or other schemes hides higher-layer information from the
firewall. Finally, a firewall cannot readily talk to the computers that communicate
through it to tell them what policies are being applied and why their connection is
being dropped. It must simply pretend to be a broken wire. For all these reasons,
networking purists consider firewalls to be a blemish on the architecture of the In-
ternet. However, the Internet can be a dangerous place if you are a computer.
Firewalls help with that problem, so they are likely to stay.
Even if the firewall is perfectly configured, plenty of security problems still
exist. For example, if a firewall is configured to allow in packets from only spe-
cific networks (e.g., the company’s other plants), an intruder outside the firewall
can put in false source addresses to bypass this check. If an insider wants to ship
out secret documents, he can encrypt them or even photograph them and ship the
photos as JPEG files, which bypasses any email filters. And we have not even
discussed the fact that, although three-quarters of all attacks come from outside
the firewall, the attacks that come from inside the firewall, for example, from dis-
gruntled employees, are typically the most damaging (Verizon, 2009).
A different problem with firewalls is that they provide a single perimeter of
defense. If that defense is breached, all bets are off. For this reason, firewalls are
often used in a layered defense. For example, a firewall may guard the entrance to
the internal network and each computer may also run its own firewall. Readers
who think that one security checkpoint is enough clearly have not made an inter-
national flight on a scheduled airline recently.
In addition, there is a whole other class of attacks that firewalls cannot deal
with. The basic idea of a firewall is to prevent intruders from getting in and secret
data from getting out. Unfortunately, there are people who have nothing better to
do than try to bring certain sites down. They do this by sending legitimate packets
at the target in great numbers until it collapses under the load. For example, to
cripple a Web site, an intruder can send a TCP SYN packet to establish a con-
nection. The site will then allocate a table slot for the connection and send a SYN
+ ACK packet in reply. If the intruder does not respond, the table slot will be tied
up for a few seconds until it times out. If the intruder sends thousands of con-
nection requests, all the table slots will fill up and no legitimate connections will
be able to get through. Attacks in which the intruder’s goal is to shut down the
target rather than steal data are called DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. Usually,
the request packets have false source addresses so the intruder cannot be traced
easily. DoS attacks against major Web sites are common on the Internet.

## Page 59

COMMUNICATION SECURITY
821
An even worse variant is one in which the intruder has already broken into
hundreds of computers elsewhere in the world, and then commands all of them to
attack the same target at the same time. Not only does this approach increase the
intruder’s firepower, but it also reduces his chances of detection since the packets
are coming from a large number of machines belonging to unsuspecting users.
Such an attack is called a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack. This at-
tack is difficult to defend against. Even if the attacked machine can quickly
recognize a bogus request, it does take some time to process and discard the re-
quest, and if enough requests per second arrive, the CPU will spend all its time
dealing with them.
8.6.3 Virtual Private Networks
Many companies have offices and plants scattered over many cities, some-
times over multiple countries. In the olden days, before public data networks, it
was common for such companies to lease lines from the telephone company be-
tween some or all pairs of locations. Some companies still do this. A network
built up from company computers and leased telephone lines is called a private
network.
Private networks work fine and are very secure. If the only lines available are
the leased lines, no traffic can leak out of company locations and intruders have to
physically wiretap the lines to break in, which is not easy to do. The problem
with private networks is that leasing a dedicated T1 line between two points costs
thousands of dollars a month, and T3 lines are many times more expensive. When
public data networks and later the Internet appeared, many companies wanted to
move their data (and possibly voice) traffic to the public network, but without giv-
ing up the security of the private network.
This demand soon led to the invention of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks),
which are overlay networks on top of public networks but with most of the proper-
ties of private networks. They are called ‘‘virtual’’ because they are merely an
illusion, just as virtual circuits are not real circuits and virtual memory is not real
memory.
One popular approach is to build VPNs directly over the Internet. A common
design is to equip each office with a firewall and create tunnels through the Inter-
net between all pairs of offices, as illustrated in Fig. 8-30(a). A further advantage
of using the Internet for connectivity is that the tunnels can be set up on demand
to include, for example, the computer of an employee who is at home or traveling
as long as the person has an Internet connection. This flexibility is much greater
then is provided with leased lines, yet from the perspective of the computers on
the VPN, the topology looks just like the private network case, as shown in
Fig. 8-30(b). When the system is brought up, each pair of firewalls has to nego-
tiate the parameters of its SA, including the services, modes, algorithms, and keys.
If IPsec is used for the tunneling, it is possible to aggregate all traffic between any

two pairs of offices onto a single authenticated, encrypted SA, thus providing in-
tegrity control, secrecy, and even considerable immunity to traffic analysis. Many
firewalls have VPN capabilities built in. Some ordinary routers can do this as
well, but since firewalls are primarily in the security business, it is natural to have
the tunnels begin and end at the firewalls, providing a clear separation between
the company and the Internet. Thus, firewalls, VPNs, and IPsec with ESP in tun-
nel mode are a natural combination and widely used in practice.
Once the SAs have been established, traffic can begin flowing. To a router
within the Internet, a packet traveling along a VPN tunnel is just an ordinary
packet. The only thing unusual about it is the presence of the IPsec header after
the IP header, but since these extra headers have no effect on the forwarding proc-
ess, the routers do not care about this extra header.
Another approach that is gaining popularity is to have the ISP set up the VPN.
Using MPLS (as discussed in Chap. 5), paths for the VPN traffic can be set up a-
cross the ISP network between the company offices. These paths keep the VPN
traffic separate from other Internet traffic and can be guaranteed a certain amount
of bandwidth or other quality of service.
A key advantage of a VPN is that it is completely transparent to all user soft-
ware. The firewalls set up and manage the SAs. The only person who is even
aware of this setup is the system administrator who has to configure and manage
the security gateways, or the ISP administrator who has to configure the MPLS
paths. To everyone else, it is like having a leased-line private network again. For
more about VPNs, see Lewis (2006).
8.6.4 Wireless Security
It is surprisingly easy to design a system using VPNs and firewalls that is log-
ically completely secure but that, in practice, leaks like a sieve. This situation can
occur if some of the machines are wireless and use radio communication, which
passes right over the firewall in both directions. The range of 802.11 networks is

often a few hundred meters, so anyone who wants to spy on a company can sim-
ply drive into the employee parking lot in the morning, leave an 802.11-enabled
notebook computer in the car to record everything it hears, and take off for the
day. By late afternoon, the hard disk will be full of valuable goodies. Theoreti-
cally, this leakage is not supposed to happen. Theoretically, people are not sup-
posed to rob banks, either.
Much of the security problem can be traced to the manufacturers of wireless
base stations (access points) trying to make their products user friendly. Usually,
if the user takes the device out of the box and plugs it into the electrical power
socket, it begins operating immediately—nearly always with no security at all,
blurting secrets to everyone within radio range. If it is then plugged into an Ether-
net, all the Ethernet traffic suddenly appears in the parking lot as well. Wireless
is a snooper’s dream come true: free data without having to do any work. It there-
fore goes without saying that security is even more important for wireless systems
than for wired ones. In this section, we will look at some ways wireless networks
handle security. Some additional information is given by Nichols and Lekkas
(2002).
802.11 Security
Part of the 802.11 standard, originally called 802.11i, prescribes a data link-
level security protocol for preventing a wireless node from reading or interfering
with messages sent between another pair of wireless nodes. It also goes by the
trade name WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2). Plain WPA is an interim scheme
that implements a subset of 802.11i. It should be avoided in favor of WPA2.
We will describe 802.11i shortly, but will first note that it is a replacement for
WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), the first generation of 802.11 security proto-
cols. WEP was designed by a networking standards committee, which is a com-
pletely different process than, for example, the way NIST selected the design of
AES. The results were devastating. What was wrong with it? Pretty much every-
thing from a security perspective as it turns out. For example, WEP encrypted
data for confidentiality by XORing it with the output of a stream cipher. Unfor-
tunately, weak keying arrangements meant that the output was often reused. This
led to trivial ways to defeat it. As another example, the integrity check was based
on a 32-bit CRC. That is an efficient code for detecting transmission errors, but it
is not a cryptographically strong mechanism for defeating attackers.
These and other design flaws made WEP very easy to compromise. The first
practical demonstration that WEP was broken came when Adam Stubblefield was
an intern at AT&T (Stubblefield et al., 2002). He was able to code up and test an
attack outlined by Fluhrer et al. (2001) in one week, of which most of the time
was spent convincing management to buy him a WiFi card to use in his experi-
ments. Software to crack WEP passwords within a minute is now freely available
and the use of WEP is very strongly discouraged. While it does prevent casual

access it does not provide any real form of security. The 802.11i group was put
together in a hurry when it was clear that WEP was seriously broken. It produced
a formal standard by June 2004.
Now we will describe 802.11i, which does provide real security if it is set up
and used properly. There are two common scenarios in which WPA2 is used. The
first is a corporate setting, in which a company has a separate authentication ser-
ver that has a username and password database that can be used to determine if a
wireless client is allowed to access the network. In this setting, clients use stan-
dard protocols to authenticate themselves to the network. The main standards are
802.1X, with which the access point lets the client carry on a dialogue with the
authentication server and observes the result, and EAP (Extensible Authentica-
tion Protocol) (RFC 3748), which tells how the client and the authentication ser-
ver interact. Actually, EAP is a framework and other standards define the proto-
col messages. However, we will not delve into the many details of this exchange
because they do not much matter for an overview.
The second scenario is in a home setting in which there is no authentication
server. Instead, there is a single shared password that is used by clients to access
the wireless network. This setup is less complex than having an authentication
server, which is why it is used at home and in small businesses, but it is less
secure as well. The main difference is that with an authentication server each cli-
ent gets a key for encrypting traffic that is not known by the other clients. With a
single shared password, different keys are derived for each client, but all clients
have the same password and can derive each others’ keys if they want to.
The keys that are used to encrypt traffic are computed as part of an
authentication handshake. The handshake happens right after the client associates
with a wireless network and authenticates with an authentication server, if there is
one. At the start of the handshake, the client has either the shared network pass-
word or its password for the authentication server. This password is used to derive
a master key. However, the master key is not used directly to encrypt packets. It
is standard cryptographic practice to derive a session key for each period of usage,
to change the key for different sessions, and to expose the master key to observa-
tion as little as possible. It is this session key that is computed in the handshake.
The session key is computed with the four-packet handshake shown in Fig. 8-
31. First, the AP (access point) sends a random number for identification. Ran-
dom numbers used just once in security protocols like this one are called nonces,
which is more-or-less a contraction of ‘‘number used once.’’ The client also picks
its own nonce. It uses the nonces, its MAC address and that of the AP, and the
master key to compute a session key, KS. The session key is split into portions,
each of which is used for different purposes, but we have omitted this detail. Now
the client has session keys, but the AP does not. So the client sends its nonce to
the AP, and the AP performs the same computation to derive the same session
keys. The nonces can be sent in the clear because the keys cannot be derived from
them without extra, secret information. The message from the client is protected

COMMUNICATION SECURITY
825
with an integrity check called a MIC (Message Integrity Check) based on the
session key. The AP can check that the MIC is correct, and so the message indeed
must have come from the client, after it computes the session keys. A MIC is just
another name for a message authentication code, as in an HMAC. The term MIC
is often used instead for networking protocols because of the potential for confu-
sion with MAC (Medium Access Control) addresses.

In the last two messages, the AP distributes a group key, KG, to the client, and
the client acknowledges the message. Receipt of these messages lets the client
verify that the AP has the correct session keys, and vice versa. The group key is
used for broadcast and multicast traffic on the 802.11 LAN. Because the result of
the handshake is that every client has its own encryption keys, none of these keys
can be used by the AP to broadcast packets to all of the wireless clients; a sepa-
rate copy would need to be sent to each client using its key. Instead, a shared key
is distributed so that broadcast traffic can be sent only once and received by all
the clients. It must be updated as clients leave and join the network.
Finally, we get to the part where the keys are actually used to provide securi-
ty. Two protocols can be used in 802.11i to provide message confidentiality, in-
tegrity, and authentication. Like WPA, one of the protocols, called TKIP (Tem-
porary Key Integrity Protocol), was an interim solution. It was designed to im-
prove security on old and slow 802.11 cards, so that at least some security that is
better than WEP can be rolled out as a firmware upgrade. However, it, too, has
now been broken so you are better off with the other, recommended protocol,
CCMP. What does CCMP stand for? It is short for the somewhat spectacular
name Counter mode with Cipher block chaining Message authentication code Pro-
tocol. We will just call it CCMP. You can call it anything you want.

---

## Page 64

826
NETWORK SECURITY
CHAP. 8
CCMP works in a fairly straightforward way. It uses AES encryption with a
128-bit key and block size. The key comes from the session key. To provide con-
fidentiality, messages are encrypted with AES in counter mode. Recall that we
discussed cipher modes in Sec. 8.2.3. These modes are what prevent the same
message from being encrypted to the same set of bits each time. Counter mode
mixes a counter into the encryption. To provide integrity, the message, including
header fields, is encrypted with cipher block chaining mode and the last 128-bit
block is kept as the MIC. Then both the message (encrypted with counter mode)
and the MIC are sent. The client and the AP can each perform this encryption, or
verify this encryption when a wireless packet is received. For broadcast or multi-
cast messages, the same procedure is used with the group key.
Bluetooth Security
Bluetooth has a considerably shorter range than 802.11, so it cannot easily be
attacked from the parking lot, but security is still an issue here. For example, im-
agine that Alice’s computer is equipped with a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. In
the absence of security, if Trudy happened to be in the adjacent office, she could
read everything Alice typed in, including all her outgoing email. She could also
capture everything Alice’s computer sent to the Bluetooth printer sitting next to it
(e.g., incoming email and confidential reports). Fortunately, Bluetooth has an ela-
borate security scheme to try to foil the world’s Trudies. We will now summarize
the main features of it.
Bluetooth version 2.1 and later has four security modes, ranging from nothing
at all to full data encryption and integrity control. As with 802.11, if security is
disabled (the default for older devices), there is no security. Most users have se-
curity turned off until a serious breach has occurred; then they turn it on. In the
agricultural world, this approach is known as locking the barn door after the horse
has escaped.
Bluetooth provides security in multiple layers. In the physical layer, frequen-
cy hopping provides a tiny little bit of security, but since any Bluetooth device
that moves into a piconet has to be told the frequency hopping sequence, this se-
quence is obviously not a secret. The real security starts when the newly arrived
slave asks for a channel with the master. Before Bluetooth 2.1, two devices were
assumed to share a secret key set up in advance.
In some cases, both are
hardwired by the manufacturer (e.g., for a headset and mobile phone sold as a
unit). In other cases, one device (e.g., the headset) has a hardwired key and the
user has to enter that key into the other device (e.g., the mobile phone) as a
decimal number. These shared keys are called passkeys. Unfortunately, the
passkeys are often hardcoded to ‘‘1234’’ or another predictable value, and in any
case are four decimal digits, allowing only 104 choices. With simple secure pair-
ing in Bluetooth 2.1, devices pick a code from a six-digit range, which makes the
passkey much less predictable but still far from secure.

---

## Page 65

SEC. 8.6
COMMUNICATION SECURITY
827
To establish a channel, the slave and master each check to see if the other one
knows the passkey. If so, they negotiate whether that channel will be encrypted,
integrity controlled, or both. Then they select a random 128-bit session key, some
of whose bits may be public. The point of allowing this key weakening is to com-
ply with government restrictions in various countries designed to prevent the
export or use of keys longer than the government can break.
Encryption uses a stream cipher called E0; integrity control uses SAFER+.
Both are traditional symmetric-key block ciphers. SAFER+ was submitted to the
AES bake-off but was eliminated in the first round because it was slower than the
other candidates. Bluetooth was finalized before the AES cipher was chosen;
otherwise, it would most likely have used Rijndael.
The actual encryption using the stream cipher is shown in Fig. 8-14, with the
plaintext XORed with the keystream to generate the ciphertext. Unfortunately,
E 0 itself (like RC4) may have fatal weaknesses (Jakobsson and Wetzel, 2001).
While it was not broken at the time of this writing, its similarities to the A5/1
cipher, whose spectacular failure compromises all GSM telephone traffic, are
cause for concern (Biryukov et al., 2000). It sometimes amazes people (including
the authors of this book), that in the perennial cat-and-mouse game between the
cryptographers and the cryptanalysts, the cryptanalysts are so often on the win-
ning side.
Another security issue is that Bluetooth authenticates only devices, not users,
so theft of a Bluetooth device may give the thief access to the user’s financial and
other accounts. However, Bluetooth also implements security in the upper layers,
so even in the event of a breach of link-level security, some security may remain,
especially for applications that require a PIN code to be entered manually from
some kind of keyboard to complete the transaction.
8.7 AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS
Authentication is the technique by which a process verifies that its communi-
cation partner is who it is supposed to be and not an imposter. Verifying the iden-
tity of a remote process in the face of a malicious, active intruder is surprisingly
difficult and requires complex protocols based on cryptography. In this section,
we will study some of the many authentication protocols that are used on insecure
computer networks.
As an aside,
some people
confuse
authorization
with
authentication.
Authentication deals with the question of whether you are actually communicating
with a specific process. Authorization is concerned with what that process is per-
mitted to do. For example, say a client process contacts a file server and says: ‘‘I
am Scott’s process and I want to delete the file cookbook.old.’’ From the file ser-
ver’s point of view, two questions must be answered:

---

## Page 66

828
NETWORK SECURITY
CHAP. 8
1. Is this actually Scott’s process (authentication)?
2. Is Scott allowed to delete cookbook.old (authorization)?
Only after both of these questions have been unambiguously answered in the affir-
mative can the requested action take place. The former question is really the key
one. Once the file server knows to whom it is talking, checking authorization is
just a matter of looking up entries in local tables or databases. For this reason, we
will concentrate on authentication in this section.
The general model that essentially all authentication protocols use is this.
Alice starts out by sending a message either to Bob or to a trusted KDC (Key Dis-
tribution Center), which is expected to be honest. Several other message ex-
changes follow in various directions. As these messages are being sent, Trudy
may intercept, modify, or replay them in order to trick Alice and Bob or just to
gum up the works.
Nevertheless, when the protocol has been completed, Alice is sure she is talk-
ing to Bob and Bob is sure he is talking to Alice. Furthermore, in most of the pro-
tocols, the two of them will also have established a secret session key for use in
the upcoming conversation. In practice, for performance reasons, all data traffic
is encrypted using symmetric-key cryptography (typically AES or triple DES), al-
though public-key cryptography is widely used for the authentication protocols
themselves and for establishing the session key.
The point of using a new, randomly chosen session key for each new con-
nection is to minimize the amount of traffic that gets sent with the users’ secret
keys or public keys, to reduce the amount of ciphertext an intruder can obtain, and
to minimize the damage done if a process crashes and its core dump falls into the
wrong hands. Hopefully, the only key present then will be the session key. All
the permanent keys should have been carefully zeroed out after the session was
established.
8.7.1 Authentication Based on a Shared Secret Key
For our first authentication protocol, we will assume that Alice and Bob al-
ready share a secret key, KAB. This shared key might have been agreed upon on
the telephone or in person, but, in any event, not on the (insecure) network.
This protocol is based on a principle found in many authentication protocols:
one party sends a random number to the other, who then transforms it in a special
way and returns the result. Such protocols are called challenge-response proto-
cols. In this and subsequent authentication protocols, the following notation will
be used:
A, B are the identities of Alice and Bob.
Ri’s are the challenges, where i identifies the challenger.
Ki’s are keys, where i indicates the owner.
KS is the session key.

AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS
829
The message sequence for our first shared-key authentication protocol is illus-
trated in Fig. 8-32. In message 1, Alice sends her identity, A, to Bob in a way that
Bob understands. Bob, of course, has no way of knowing whether this message
came from Alice or from Trudy, so he chooses a challenge, a large random num-
ber, RB, and sends it back to ‘‘Alice’’ as message 2, in plaintext. Alice then en-
crypts the message with the key she shares with Bob and sends the ciphertext,
KAB(RB), back in message 3. When Bob sees this message, he immediately
knows that it came from Alice because Trudy does not know KAB and thus could
not have generated it. Furthermore, since RB was chosen randomly from a large
space (say, 128-bit random numbers), it is very unlikely that Trudy would have
seen RB and its response in an earlier session. It is equally unlikely that she could
guess the correct response to any challenge.

At this point, Bob is sure he is talking to Alice, but Alice is not sure of any-
thing. For all Alice knows, Trudy might have intercepted message 1 and sent
back RB in response. Maybe Bob died last night. To find out to whom she is talk-
ing, Alice picks a random number, RA, and sends it to Bob as plaintext, in mes-
sage 4. When Bob responds with KAB(RA), Alice knows she is talking to Bob. If
they wish to establish a session key now, Alice can pick one, KS, and send it to
Bob encrypted with KAB.
The protocol of Fig. 8-32 contains five messages. Let us see if we can be
clever and eliminate some of them. One approach is illustrated in Fig. 8-33. Here
Alice initiates the challenge-response protocol instead of waiting for Bob to do it.
Similarly, while he is responding to Alice’s challenge, Bob sends his own. The
entire protocol can be reduced to three messages instead of five.
Is this new protocol an improvement over the original one? In one sense it is:
it is shorter. Unfortunately, it is also wrong. Under certain circumstances, Trudy
can defeat this protocol by using what is known as a reflection attack. In partic-
ular, Trudy can break it if it is possible to open multiple sessions with Bob at
once. This situation would be true, for example, if Bob is a bank and is prepared
to accept many simultaneous connections from teller machines at once.

Trudy’s reflection attack is shown in Fig. 8-34. It starts out with Trudy claim-

RB. Now Trudy is stuck. What can she do? She does not know KAB(RB).

She can open a second session with message 3, supplying the RB taken from
message 2 as her challenge. Bob calmly encrypts it and sends back KAB(RB) in
message 4. We have shaded the messages on the second session to make them
stand out. Now Trudy has the missing information, so she can complete the first
session and abort the second one. Bob is now convinced that Trudy is Alice, so
when she asks for her bank account balance, he gives it to her without question.
Then when she asks him to transfer it all to a secret bank account in Switzerland,
he does so without a moment’s hesitation.
The moral of this story is:
Designing a correct authentication protocol is much harder than it looks.
The following four general rules often help the designer avoid common pitfalls:

---

## Page 69

SEC. 8.7
AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS
831
1. Have the initiator prove who she is before the responder has to. This
avoids Bob giving away valuable information before Trudy has to
give any evidence of who she is.
2. Have the initiator and responder use different keys for proof, even if
this means having two shared keys, KAB and K′AB.
3. Have the initiator and responder draw their challenges from different
sets. For example, the initiator must use even numbers and the re-
sponder must use odd numbers.
4. Make the protocol resistant to attacks involving a second parallel
session in which information obtained in one session is used in a dif-
ferent one.
If even one of these rules is violated, the protocol can frequently be broken. Here,
all four rules were violated, with disastrous consequences.
Now let us go take a closer look at Fig. 8-32. Surely that protocol is not sub-
ject to a reflection attack? Maybe. It is quite subtle. Trudy was able to defeat
our protocol by using a reflection attack because it was possible to open a second
session with Bob and trick him into answering his own questions. What would
happen if Alice were a general-purpose computer that also accepted multiple ses-
sions, rather than a person at a computer? Let us take a look what Trudy can do.
To see how Trudy’s attack works, see Fig. 8-35. Alice starts out by announc-
ing her identity in message 1. Trudy intercepts this message and begins her own
session with message 2, claiming to be Bob. Again we have shaded the session 2
messages. Alice responds to message 2 by saying in message 3: ‘‘You claim to be
Bob? Prove it.’’ At this point, Trudy is stuck because she cannot prove she is Bob.
What does Trudy do now? She goes back to the first session, where it is her
turn to send a challenge, and sends the RA she got in message 3. Alice kindly re-
sponds to it in message 5, thus supplying Trudy with the information she needs to
send in message 6 in session 2. At this point, Trudy is basically home free be-
cause she has successfully responded to Alice’s challenge in session 2. She can
now cancel session 1, send over any old number for the rest of session 2, and she
will have an authenticated session with Alice in session 2.
But Trudy is nasty, and she really wants to rub it in. Instead, of sending any
old number over to complete session 2, she waits until Alice sends message 7,
Alice’s challenge for session 1. Of course, Trudy does not know how to respond,
so she uses the reflection attack again, sending back RA 2 as message 8. Alice
conveniently encrypts RA 2 in message 9. Trudy now switches back to session 1
and sends Alice the number she wants in message 10, conveniently copied from
what Alice sent in message 9. At this point Trudy has two fully authenticated ses-
sions with Alice.
This attack has a somewhat different result than the attack on the three-mes-
sage protocol that we saw in Fig. 8-34. This time, Trudy has two authenticated

connections with Alice. In the previous example, she had one authenticated con-
nection with Bob. Again here, if we had applied all the general authentication
protocol rules discussed earlier, this attack could have been stopped. For a de-
tailed discussion of these kinds of attacks and how to thwart them, see Bird et al.
(1993). They also show how it is possible to systematically construct protocols
that are provably correct. The simplest such protocol is nevertheless a bit compli-
cated, so we will now show a different class of protocol that also works.
The new authentication protocol is shown in Fig. 8-36 (Bird et al., 1993). It
uses an HMAC of the type we saw when studying IPsec. Alice starts out by send-
ing Bob a nonce, RA, as message 1. Bob responds by selecting his own nonce,
RB, and sending it back along with an HMAC. The HMAC is formed by building
a data structure consisting of Alice’s nonce, Bob’s nonce, their identities, and the
shared secret key, KAB. This data structure is then hashed into the HMAC, for ex-
ample, using SHA-1. When Alice receives message 2, she now has RA (which
she picked herself), RB, which arrives as plaintext, the two identities, and the
secret key, KAB, which she has known all along, so she can compute the HMAC
herself. If it agrees with the HMAC in the message, she knows she is talking to
Bob because Trudy does not know KAB and thus cannot figure out which HMAC
to send. Alice responds to Bob with an HMAC containing just the two nonces.
Can Trudy somehow subvert this protocol? No, because she cannot force ei-
ther party to encrypt or hash a value of her choice, as happened in Fig. 8-34 and
Fig. 8-35. Both HMACs include values chosen by the sending party, something
that Trudy cannot control.

Using HMACs is not the only way to use this idea. An alternative scheme
that is often used instead of computing the HMAC over a series of items is to en-
crypt the items sequentially using cipher block chaining.
8.7.2 Establishing a Shared Key: The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
So far, we have assumed that Alice and Bob share a secret key. Suppose that
they do not (because so far there is no universally accepted PKI for signing and
distributing certificates). How can they establish one? One way would be for
Alice to call Bob and give him her key on the phone, but he would probably start
out by saying: ‘‘How do I know you are Alice and not Trudy?’’ They could try to
arrange a meeting, with each one bringing a passport, a driver’s license, and three
major credit cards, but being busy people, they might not be able to find a mutu-
ally acceptable date for months. Fortunately, incredible as it may sound, there is a
way for total strangers to establish a shared secret key in broad daylight, even
with Trudy carefully recording every message.
The protocol that allows strangers to establish a shared secret key is called the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange (Diffie and Hellman, 1976) and works as follows.
Alice and Bob have to agree on two large numbers, n and g, where n is a prime,
(n −1)/2 is also a prime, and certain conditions apply to g. These numbers may
be public, so either one of them can just pick n and g and tell the other openly.
Now Alice picks a large (say, 1024-bit) number, x, and keeps it secret. Similarly,
Bob picks a large secret number, y.
Alice initiates the key exchange protocol by sending Bob a message con-
taining (n, g, g x mod n), as shown in Fig. 8-37. Bob responds by sending Alice a
message containing g y mod n. Now Alice raises the number Bob sent her to the
xth power modulo n to get (g y mod n)x mod n. Bob performs a similar operation
to get (g x mod n)y mod n. By the laws of modular arithmetic, both calculations
yield g xy mod n. Lo and behold, as if by magic, Alice and Bob suddenly share a
secret key, g xy mod n.

Trudy, of course, has seen both messages. She knows g and n from message
1. If she could compute x and y, she could figure out the secret key. The trouble
is, given only g x mod n, she cannot find x. No practical algorithm for computing
discrete logarithms modulo a very large prime number is known.
To make this example more concrete, we will use the (completely unrealistic)
values of n = 47 and g = 3. Alice picks x = 8 and Bob picks y = 10. Both of
these are kept secret. Alice’s message to Bob is (47, 3, 28) because 38 mod 47 is
28. Bob’s message to Alice is (17). Alice computes 178 mod 47, which is 4. Bob
computes 2810 mod 47, which is 4. Alice and Bob have now independently deter-
mined that the secret key is now 4. To find the key, Trudy now has to solve the
equation 3x mod 47 = 28, which can be done by exhaustive search for small num-
bers like this, but not when all the numbers are hundreds of bits long. All currently
known algorithms simply take far too long, even on massively parallel, lightning
fast supercomputers.
Despite the elegance of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, there is a problem:
when Bob gets the triple (47, 3, 28), how does he know it is from Alice and not
from Trudy? There is no way he can know. Unfortunately, Trudy can exploit this
fact to deceive both Alice and Bob, as illustrated in Fig. 8-38. Here, while Alice
and Bob are choosing x and y, respectively, Trudy picks her own random number,
z. Alice sends message 1, intended for Bob. Trudy intercepts it and sends mes-
sage 2 to Bob, using the correct g and n (which are public anyway) but with her
own z instead of x. She also sends message 3 back to Alice. Later Bob sends
message 4 to Alice, which Trudy again intercepts and keeps.
Now everybody does the modular arithmetic. Alice computes the secret key
as g xz mod n, and so does Trudy (for messages to Alice).
Bob computes
g yz mod n and so does Trudy (for messages to Bob). Alice thinks she is talking to
Bob, so she establishes a session key (with Trudy). So does Bob. Every message
that Alice sends on the encrypted session is captured by Trudy, stored, modified if
desired, and then (optionally) passed on to Bob. Similarly, in the other direction,
Trudy sees everything and can modify all messages at will, while both Alice and
Bob are under the illusion that they have a secure channel to one another. For this

reason, the attack is known as the man-in-the-middle attack. It is also called the
bucket brigade attack, because it vaguely resembles an old-time volunteer fire
department passing buckets along the line from the fire truck to the fire.
8.7.3 Authentication Using a Key Distribution Center
Setting up a shared secret with a stranger almost worked, but not quite. On
the other hand, it probably was not worth doing in the first place (sour grapes at-
tack). To talk to n people this way, you would need n keys. For popular people,
key management would become a real burden, especially if each key had to be
stored on a separate plastic chip card.
A different approach is to introduce a trusted key distribution center. In this
model, each user has a single key shared with the KDC. Authentication and ses-
sion key management now go through the KDC. The simplest known KDC
authentication protocol involving two parties and a trusted KDC is depicted in
Fig. 8-39.

Figure 8-39. A first attempt at an authentication protocol using a KDC.
The idea behind this protocol is simple: Alice picks a session key, KS, and
tells the KDC that she wants to talk to Bob using KS. This message is encrypted

with the secret key Alice shares (only) with the KDC, KA. The KDC decrypts this
message, extracting Bob’s identity and the session key. It then constructs a new
message containing Alice’s identity and the session key and sends this message to
Bob. This encryption is done with KB, the secret key Bob shares with the KDC.
When Bob decrypts the message, he learns that Alice wants to talk to him and
which key she wants to use.
The authentication here happens for free. The KDC knows that message 1
must have come from Alice, since no one else would have been able to encrypt it
with Alice’s secret key. Similarly, Bob knows that message 2 must have come
from the KDC, whom he trusts, since no one else knows his secret key.
Unfortunately, this protocol has a serious flaw. Trudy needs some money, so
she figures out some legitimate service she can perform for Alice, makes an
attractive offer, and gets the job. After doing the work, Trudy then politely re-
quests Alice to pay by bank transfer. Alice then establishes a session key with her
banker, Bob. Then she sends Bob a message requesting money to be transferred
to Trudy’s account.
Meanwhile, Trudy is back to her old ways, snooping on the network. She
copies both message 2 in Fig. 8-39 and the money-transfer request that follows it.
Later, she replays both of them to Bob who thinks: ‘‘Alice must have hired Trudy
again. She clearly does good work.’’ Bob then transfers an equal amount of mon-
ey from Alice’s account to Trudy’s. Some time after the 50th message pair, Bob
runs out of the office to find Trudy to offer her a big loan so she can expand her
obviously successful business. This problem is called the replay attack.
Several solutions to the replay attack are possible. The first one is to include
a timestamp in each message. Then, if anyone receives an obsolete message, it
can be discarded. The trouble with this approach is that clocks are never exactly
synchronized over a network, so there has to be some interval during which a
timestamp is valid. Trudy can replay the message during this interval and get
away with it.
The second solution is to put a nonce in each message. Each party then has to
remember all previous nonces and reject any message containing a previously
used nonce. But nonces have to be remembered forever, lest Trudy try replaying
a 5-year-old message. Also, if some machine crashes and it loses its nonce list, it
is again vulnerable to a replay attack. Timestamps and nonces can be combined
to limit how long nonces have to be remembered, but clearly the protocol is going
to get a lot more complicated.
A more sophisticated approach to mutual authentication is to use a multiway
challenge-response protocol. A well-known example of such a protocol is the
Needham-Schroeder authentication protocol (Needham and Schroeder, 1978),
one variant of which is shown in Fig. 8-40.
The protocol begins with Alice telling the KDC that she wants to talk to Bob.
This message contains a large random number, RA, as a nonce. The KDC sends
back message 2 containing Alice’s random number, a session key, and a ticket

that she can send to Bob. The point of the random number, RA, is to assure Alice
that message 2 is fresh, and not a replay. Bob’s identity is also enclosed in case
Trudy gets any funny ideas about replacing B in message 1 with her own identity
so the KDC will encrypt the ticket at the end of message 2 with KT instead of KB.
The ticket encrypted with KB is included inside the encrypted message to prevent
Trudy from replacing it with something else on the way back to Alice.
Alice now sends the ticket to Bob, along with a new random number, RA 2, en-
crypted with the session key, KS. In message 4, Bob sends back KS(RA 2 −1) to
prove to Alice that she is talking to the real Bob. Sending back KS(RA 2) would
not have worked, since Trudy could just have stolen it from message 3.
After receiving message 4, Alice is now convinced that she is talking to Bob
and that no replays could have been used so far. After all, she just generated RA 2
a few milliseconds ago. The purpose of message 5 is to convince Bob that it is
indeed Alice he is talking to, and no replays are being used here either. By having
each party both generate a challenge and respond to one, the possibility of any
kind of replay attack is eliminated.
Although this protocol seems pretty solid, it does have a slight weakness. If
Trudy ever manages to obtain an old session key in plaintext, she can initiate a
new session with Bob by replaying the message 3 that corresponds to the
compromised key and convince him that she is Alice (Denning and Sacco, 1981).
This time she can plunder Alice’s bank account without having to perform the
legitimate service even once.
Needham and Schroeder (1987) later published a protocol that corrects this
problem. In the same issue of the same journal, Otway and Rees (1987) also pub-
lished a protocol that solves the problem in a shorter way. Figure 8-41 shows a
slightly modified Otway-Rees protocol.
In the Otway-Rees protocol, Alice starts out by generating a pair of random
numbers: R, which will be used as a common identifier, and RA, which Alice will
use to challenge Bob. When Bob gets this message, he constructs a new message
from the encrypted part of Alice’s message and an analogous one of his own.

Both the parts encrypted with KA and KB identify Alice and Bob, contain the com-
mon identifier, and contain a challenge.
The KDC checks to see if the R in both parts is the same. It might not be if
Trudy has tampered with R in message 1 or replaced part of message 2. If the two
Rs match, the KDC believes that the request message from Bob is valid. It then
generates a session key and encrypts it twice, once for Alice and once for Bob.
Each message contains the receiver’s random number, as proof that the KDC, and
not Trudy, generated the message. At this point, both Alice and Bob are in
possession of the same session key and can start communicating. The first time
they exchange data messages, each one can see that the other one has an identical
copy of KS, so the authentication is then complete.
8.7.4 Authentication Using Kerberos
An authentication protocol used in many real systems (including Windows
2000 and later versions) is Kerberos, which is based on a variant of Needham-
Schroeder. It is named for a multiheaded dog in Greek mythology that used to
guard the entrance to Hades (presumably to keep undesirables out). Kerberos was
designed at M.I.T. to allow workstation users to access network resources in a
secure way. Its biggest difference from Needham-Schroeder is its assumption that
all clocks are fairly well synchronized. The protocol has gone through several
iterations. V5 is the one that is widely used in industry and defined in RFC 4120.
The earlier version, V4, was finally retired after serious flaws were found (Yu et
al., 2004). V5 improves on V4 with many small changes to the protocol and some
improved features, such as the fact that it no longer relies on the now-dated DES.
For more information, see Neuman and Ts’o (1994).
Kerberos involves three servers in addition to Alice (a client workstation):
1. Authentication Server (AS): Verifies users during login.
2. Ticket-Granting Server (TGS): Issues ‘‘proof of identity tickets.’’
3. Bob the server: Actually does the work Alice wants performed.

---

## Page 77

839
AS is similar to a KDC in that it shares a secret password with every user. The
TGS’s job is to issue tickets that can convince the real servers that the bearer of a
TGS ticket really is who he or she claims to be.
To start a session, Alice sits down at an arbitrary public workstation and types
her name. The workstation sends her name and the name of the TGS to the AS in
plaintext, as shown in message 1 of Fig. 8-42. What comes back is a session key
and a ticket, KTGS(A, KS,t), intended for the TGS. The session key is encrypted
using Alice’s secret key, so that only Alice can decrypt it. Only when message 2
arrives does the workstation ask for Alice’s password—not before then. The
password is then used to generate KA in order to decrypt message 2 and obtain the
session key.
At this point, the workstation overwrites Alice’s password to make sure that it
is only inside the workstation for a few milliseconds at most. If Trudy tries log-
ging in as Alice, the password she types will be wrong and the workstation will
detect this because the standard part of message 2 will be incorrect.

After she logs in, Alice may tell the workstation that she wants to contact Bob
the file server. The workstation then sends message 3 to the TGS asking for a
ticket to use with Bob. The key element in this request is the ticket KTGS(A, KS,t),
which is encrypted with the TGS’s secret key and used as proof that the sender
really is Alice. The TGS responds in message 4 by creating a session key, KAB,
for Alice to use with Bob. Two versions of it are sent back. The first is encrypted
with only KS, so Alice can read it. The second is another ticket, encrypted with
Bob’s key, KB, so Bob can read it.

CHAP. 8
Trudy can copy message 3 and try to use it again, but she will be foiled by the
encrypted timestamp, t, sent along with it. Trudy cannot replace the timestamp
with a more recent one, because she does not know KS, the session key Alice uses
to talk to the TGS. Even if Trudy replays message 3 quickly, all she will get is
another copy of message 4, which she could not decrypt the first time and will not
be able to decrypt the second time either.
Now Alice can send KAB to Bob via the new ticket to establish a session with
him (message 5). This exchange is also timestamped. The optional response
(message 6) is proof to Alice that she is actually talking to Bob, not to Trudy.
After this series of exchanges, Alice can communicate with Bob under cover
of KAB. If she later decides she needs to talk to another server, Carol, she just re-
peats message 3 to the TGS, only now specifying C instead of B. The TGS will
promptly respond with a ticket encrypted with KC that Alice can send to Carol
and that Carol will accept as proof that it came from Alice.
The point of all this work is that now Alice can access servers all over the net-
work in a secure way and her password never has to go over the network. In fact,
it only had to be in her own workstation for a few milliseconds. However, note
that each server does its own authorization. When Alice presents her ticket to
Bob, this merely proves to Bob who sent it. Precisely what Alice is allowed to do
is up to Bob.
Since the Kerberos designers did not expect the entire world to trust a single
authentication server, they made provision for having multiple realms, each with
its own AS and TGS. To get a ticket for a server in a distant realm, Alice would
ask her own TGS for a ticket accepted by the TGS in the distant realm. If the dis-
tant TGS has registered with the local TGS (the same way local servers do), the
local TGS will give Alice a ticket valid at the distant TGS. She can then do busi-
ness over there, such as getting tickets for servers in that realm. Note, however,
that for parties in two realms to do business, each one must trust the other’s TGS.
Otherwise, they cannot do business.
8.7.5 Authentication Using Public-Key Cryptography
Mutual authentication can also be done using public-key cryptography. To
start with, Alice needs to get Bob’s public key. If a PKI exists with a directory
server that hands out certificates for public keys, Alice can ask for Bob’s, as
shown in Fig. 8-43 as message 1. The reply, in message 2, is an X.509 certificate
containing Bob’s public key. When Alice verifies that the signature is correct, she
sends Bob a message containing her identity and a nonce.
When Bob receives this message, he has no idea whether it came from Alice
or from Trudy, but he plays along and asks the directory server for Alice’s public
key (message 4), which he soon gets (message 5). He then sends Alice message
6, containing Alice’s RA, his own nonce, RB, and a proposed session key, KS.

When Alice gets message 6, she decrypts it using her private key. She sees
RA in it, which gives her a warm feeling inside. The message must have come
from Bob, since Trudy has no way of determining RA. Furthermore, it must be
fresh and not a replay, since she just sent Bob RA. Alice agrees to the session by
sending back message 7. When Bob sees RB encrypted with the session key he
just generated, he knows Alice got message 6 and verified RA. Bob is now a
happy camper.
What can Trudy do to try to subvert this protocol? She can fabricate message
3 and trick Bob into probing Alice, but Alice will see an RA that she did not send
and will not proceed further. Trudy cannot forge message 7 back to Bob because
she does not know RB or KS and cannot determine them without Alice’s private
key. She is out of luck.
8.8 EMAIL SECURITY
When an email message is sent between two distant sites, it will generally
transit dozens of machines on the way. Any of these can read and record the mes-
sage for future use. In practice, privacy is nonexistent, despite what many people
think. Nevertheless, many people would like to be able to send email that can be
read by the intended recipient and no one else: not their boss and not even their
government. This desire has stimulated several people and groups to apply the
cryptographic principles we studied earlier to email to produce secure email. In
the following sections we will study a widely used secure email system, PGP, and
then briefly mention one other, S/MIME. For additional information about secure
email, see Kaufman et al. (2002) and Schneier (1995).

8.8.1 PGP—Pretty Good Privacy
Our first example, PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is essentially the brainchild
of one person, Phil Zimmermann (1995a, 1995b). Zimmermann is a privacy
advocate whose motto is: ‘‘If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have priva-
cy.’’ Released in 1991, PGP is a complete email security package that provides
privacy, authentication, digital signatures, and compression, all in an easy-to-use
form. Furthermore, the complete package, including all the source code, is dis-
tributed free of charge via the Internet. Due to its quality, price (zero), and easy
availability on UNIX, Linux, Windows, and Mac OS platforms, it is widely used
today.
PGP encrypts data by using a block cipher called IDEA (International Data
Encryption Algorithm), which uses 128-bit keys. It was devised in Switzerland
at a time when DES was seen as tainted and AES had not yet been invented. Con-
ceptually, IDEA is similar to DES and AES: it mixes up the bits in a series of
rounds, but the details of the mixing functions are different from DES and AES.
Key management uses RSA and data integrity uses MD5, topics that we have al-
ready discussed.
PGP has also been embroiled in controversy since day 1 (Levy, 1993). Be-
cause Zimmermann did nothing to stop other people from placing PGP on the In-
ternet, where people all over the world could get it, the U.S. Government claimed
that Zimmermann had violated U.S. laws prohibiting the export of munitions. The
U.S. Government’s investigation of Zimmermann went on for 5 years but was
eventually dropped, probably for two reasons. First, Zimmermann did not place
PGP on the Internet himself, so his lawyer claimed that he never exported any-
thing (and then there is the little matter of whether creating a Web site constitutes
export at all). Second, the government eventually came to realize that winning a
trial meant convincing a jury that a Web site containing a downloadable privacy
program was covered by the arms-trafficking law prohibiting the export of war
materiel such as tanks, submarines, military aircraft, and nuclear weapons. Years
of negative publicity probably did not help much, either.
As an aside, the export rules are bizarre, to put it mildly. The government
considered putting code on a Web site to be an illegal export and harassed Zim-
mermann about it for 5 years. On the other hand, when someone published the
complete PGP source code, in C, as a book (in a large font with a checksum on
each page to make scanning it in easy) and then exported the book, that was fine
with the government because books are not classified as munitions. The sword is
mightier than the pen, at least for Uncle Sam.
Another problem PGP ran into involved patent infringement. The company
holding the RSA patent, RSA Security, Inc., alleged that PGP’s use of the RSA
algorithm infringed on its patent, but that problem was settled with releases start-
ing at 2.6. Furthermore, PGP uses another patented encryption algorithm, IDEA,
whose use caused some problems at first.

Since PGP is open source, various people and groups have modified it and
produced a number of versions. Some of these were designed to get around the
munitions laws, others were focused on avoiding the use of patented algorithms,
and still others wanted to turn it into a closed-source commercial product. Al-
though the munitions laws have now been slightly liberalized (otherwise, products
using AES would not have been exportable from the U.S.), and the RSA patent
expired in September 2000, the legacy of all these problems is that several incom-
patible versions of PGP are in circulation, under various names. The discussion
below focuses on classic PGP, which is the oldest and simplest version. Another
popular version, Open PGP, is described in RFC 2440. Yet another is the GNU
Privacy Guard.
PGP intentionally uses existing cryptographic algorithms rather than inventing
new ones. It is largely based on algorithms that have withstood extensive peer
review and were not designed or influenced by any government agency trying to
weaken them. For people who distrust government, this property is a big plus.
PGP supports text compression, secrecy, and digital signatures and also pro-
vides extensive key management facilities, but, oddly enough, not email facilities.
It is like a preprocessor that takes plaintext as input and produces signed cipher-
text in base64 as output. This output can then be emailed, of course. Some PGP
implementations call a user agent as the final step to actually send the message.
To see how PGP works, let us consider the example of Fig. 8-44. Here, Alice
wants to send a signed plaintext message, P, to Bob in a secure way. Both Alice
and Bob have private (DX) and public (EX) RSA keys. Let us assume that each
one knows the other’s public key; we will cover PGP key management shortly.
Alice starts out by invoking the PGP program on her computer. PGP first
hashes her message, P, using MD5, and then encrypts the resulting hash using her
private RSA key, DA. When Bob eventually gets the message, he can decrypt the
hash with Alice’s public key and verify that the hash is correct. Even if someone
else (e.g., Trudy) could acquire the hash at this stage and decrypt it with Alice’s
known public key, the strength of MD5 guarantees that it would be computa-
tionally infeasible to produce another message with the same MD5 hash.
The encrypted hash and the original message are now concatenated into a sin-
gle message, P1, and compressed using the ZIP program, which uses the Ziv-
Lempel algorithm (Ziv and Lempel, 1977). Call the output of this step P1.Z.
Next, PGP prompts Alice for some random input. Both the content and the
typing speed are used to generate a 128-bit IDEA message key, KM (called a ses-
sion key in the PGP literature, but this is really a misnomer since there is no ses-
sion). KM is now used to encrypt P1.Z with IDEA in cipher feedback mode. In
addition, KM is encrypted with Bob’s public key, EB. These two components are
then concatenated and converted to base64, as we discussed in the section on
MIME in Chap. 7. The resulting message contains only letters, digits, and the
symbols +, /, and =, which means it can be put into an RFC 822 body and be ex-
pected to arrive unmodified.

When Bob gets the message, he reverses the base64 encoding and decrypts
the IDEA key using his private RSA key. Using this key, he decrypts the message
to get P1.Z. After decompressing it, Bob separates the plaintext from the en-
crypted hash and decrypts the hash using Alice’s public key. If the plaintext hash
agrees with his own MD5 computation, he knows that P is the correct message
and that it came from Alice.
It is worth noting that RSA is only used in two places here: to encrypt the
128-bit MD5 hash and to encrypt the 128-bit IDEA key. Although RSA is slow, it
has to encrypt only 256 bits, not a large volume of data. Furthermore, all 256
plaintext bits are exceedingly random, so a considerable amount of work will be
required on Trudy’s part just to determine if a guessed key is correct. The heavy-
duty encryption is done by IDEA, which is orders of magnitude faster than RSA.
Thus, PGP provides security, compression, and a digital signature and does so in a
much more efficient way than the scheme illustrated in Fig. 8-19.
PGP supports four RSA key lengths. It is up to the user to select the one that
is most appropriate. The lengths are:
1. Casual (384 bits): Can be broken easily today.
2. Commercial (512 bits): Breakable by three-letter organizations.
3. Military (1024 bits): Not breakable by anyone on earth.
4. Alien (2048 bits): Not breakable by anyone on other planets, either.

Since RSA is only used for two small computations, everyone should use alien-
strength keys all the time.
The format of a classic PGP message is shown in Fig. 8-45. Numerous other
formats are also in use. The message has three parts, containing the IDEA key,
the signature, and the message, respectively. The key part contains not only the
key, but also a key identifier, since users are permitted to have multiple public
keys.

The signature part contains a header, which will not concern us here. The
header is followed by a timestamp, the identifier for the sender’s public key that
can be used to decrypt the signature hash, some type information that identifies
the algorithms used (to allow MD6 and RSA2 to be used when they are invented),
and the encrypted hash itself.
The message part also contains a header, the default name of the file to be
used if the receiver writes the file to the disk, a message creation timestamp, and,
finally, the message itself.
Key management has received a large amount of attention in PGP as it is the
Achilles’ heel of all security systems. Key management works as follows. Each
user maintains two data structures locally: a private key ring and a public key
ring. The private key ring contains one or more personal private/public key
pairs. The reason for supporting multiple pairs per user is to permit users to
change their public keys periodically or when one is thought to have been
compromised, without invalidating messages currently in preparation or in transit.
Each pair has an identifier associated with it so that a message sender can tell the
recipient which public key was used to encrypt it. Message identifiers consist of
the low-order 64 bits of the public key. Users are themselves responsible for
avoiding conflicts in their public-key identifiers. The private keys on disk are en-
crypted using a special (arbitrarily long) password to protect them against sneak
attacks.
The public key ring contains public keys of the user’s correspondents. These
are needed to encrypt the message keys associated with each message. Each entry

---

NETWORK SECURITY
CHAP. 8
on the public key ring contains not only the public key, but also its 64-bit identi-
fier and an indication of how strongly the user trusts the key.
The problem being tackled here is the following. Suppose that public keys
are maintained on bulletin boards. One way for Trudy to read Bob’s secret email
is to attack the bulletin board and replace Bob’s public key with one of her choice.
When Alice later fetches the key allegedly belonging to Bob, Trudy can mount a
bucket brigade attack on Bob.
To prevent such attacks, or at least minimize the consequences of them, Alice
needs to know how much to trust the item called ‘‘Bob’s key’’ on her public key
ring. If she knows that Bob personally handed her a CD-ROM containing the key,
she can set the trust value to the highest value. It is this decentralized, user-con-
trolled approach to public-key management that sets PGP apart from centralized
PKI schemes.
Nevertheless, people do sometimes obtain public keys by querying a trusted
key server. For this reason, after X.509 was standardized, PGP supported these
certificates as well as the traditional PGP public key ring mechanism. All current
versions of PGP have X.509 support.
8.8.2 S/MIME
IETF’s venture into email security, called S/MIME (Secure/MIME), is de-
scribed in RFCs 2632 through 2643. It provides authentication, data integrity,
secrecy, and nonrepudiation. It also is quite flexible, supporting a variety of
cryptographic algorithms. Not surprisingly, given the name, S/MIME integrates
well with MIME, allowing all kinds of messages to be protected. A variety of
new MIME headers are defined, for example, for holding digital signatures.
S/MIME does not have a rigid certificate hierarchy beginning at a single root,
which had been one of the political problems that doomed an earlier system called
PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). Instead, users can have multiple trust anchors.
As long as a certificate can be traced back to some trust anchor the user believes
in, it is considered valid. S/MIME uses the standard algorithms and protocols we
have been examining so far, so we will not discuss it any further here. For the de-
tails, please consult the RFCs.
8.9 WEB SECURITY
We have just studied two important areas where security is needed: communi-
cations and email. You can think of these as the soup and appetizer. Now it is
time for the main course: Web security. The Web is where most of the Trudies
hang out nowadays and do their dirty work. In the following sections, we will
look at some of the problems and issues relating to Web security.

## Page 85

SEC. 8.9
WEB SECURITY
847
Web security can be roughly divided into three parts. First, how are objects
and resources named securely? Second, how can secure, authenticated connec-
tions be established? Third, what happens when a Web site sends a client a piece
of executable code? After looking at some threats, we will examine all these is-
sues.
8.9.1 Threats
One reads about Web site security problems in the newspaper almost weekly.
The situation is really pretty grim. Let us look at a few examples of what has al-
ready happened. First, the home pages of numerous organizations have been at-
tacked and replaced by new home pages of the crackers’ choosing. (The popular
press calls people who break into computers ‘‘hackers,’’ but many programmers
reserve that term for great programmers. We prefer to call these people ‘‘crack-
ers.’’) Sites that have been cracked include those belonging to Yahoo!, the U.S.
Army, the CIA, NASA, and the New York Times. In most cases, the crackers just
put up some funny text and the sites were repaired within a few hours.
Now let us look at some much more serious cases. Numerous sites have been
brought down by denial-of-service attacks, in which the cracker floods the site
with traffic, rendering it unable to respond to legitimate queries. Often, the attack
is mounted from a large number of machines that the cracker has already broken
into (DDoS attacks). These attacks are so common that they do not even make
the news any more, but they can cost the attacked sites thousands of dollars in lost
business.
In 1999, a Swedish cracker broke into Microsoft’s Hotmail Web site and
created a mirror site that allowed anyone to type in the name of a Hotmail user
and then read all of the person’s current and archived email.
In another case, a 19-year-old Russian cracker named Maxim broke into an
e-commerce Web site and stole 300,000 credit card numbers.
Then he ap-
proached the site owners and told them that if they did not pay him $100,000, he
would post all the credit card numbers to the Internet. They did not give in to his
blackmail, and he indeed posted the credit card numbers, inflicting great damage
on many innocent victims.
In a different vein, a 23-year-old California student emailed a press release to
a news agency falsely stating that the Emulex Corporation was going to post a
large quarterly loss and that the C.E.O. was resigning immediately. Within hours,
the company’s stock dropped by 60%, causing stockholders to lose over $2 bil-
lion. The perpetrator made a quarter of a million dollars by selling the stock short
just before sending the announcement. While this event was not a Web site
break-in, it is clear that putting such an announcement on the home page of any
big corporation would have a similar effect.
We could (unfortunately) go on like this for many more pages. But it is now
time to examine some of the technical issues related to Web security. For more

information about security problems of all kinds, see Anderson (2008a); Stuttard
and Pinto (2007); and Schneier (2004). Searching the Internet will also turn up
vast numbers of specific cases.
8.9.2 Secure Naming
Let us start with something very basic: Alice wants to visit Bob’s Web site.
She types Bob’s URL into her browser and a few seconds later, a Web page ap-
pears. But is it Bob’s? Maybe yes and maybe no. Trudy might be up to her old
tricks again. For example, she might be intercepting all of Alice’s outgoing pack-
ets and examining them. When she captures an HTTP GET request headed to
Bob’s Web site, she could go to Bob’s Web site herself to get the page, modify it
as she wishes, and return the fake page to Alice. Alice would be none the wiser.
Worse yet, Trudy could slash the prices at Bob’s e-store to make his goods look
very attractive, thereby tricking Alice into sending her credit card number to
‘‘Bob’’ to buy some merchandise.
One disadvantage of this classic man-in-the-middle attack is that Trudy has to
be in a position to intercept Alice’s outgoing traffic and forge her incoming traf-
fic. In practice, she has to tap either Alice’s phone line or Bob’s, since tapping
the fiber backbone is fairly difficult. While active wiretapping is certainly pos-
sible, it is a fair amount of work, and while Trudy is clever, she is also lazy.
Besides, there are easier ways to trick Alice.
DNS Spoofing
One way would be for Trudy to crack the DNS system or maybe just the DNS
cache at Alice’s ISP, and replace Bob’s IP address (say, 36.1.2.3) with her
(Trudy’s) IP address (say, 42.9.9.9). That leads to the following attack. The way
it is supposed to work is illustrated in Fig. 8-46(a). Here, Alice (1) asks DNS for
Bob’s IP address, (2) gets it, (3) asks Bob for his home page, and (4) gets that,
too. After Trudy has modified Bob’s DNS record to contain her own IP address
instead of Bob’s, we get the situation in Fig. 8-46(b). Here, when Alice looks up
Bob’s IP address, she gets Trudy’s, so all her traffic intended for Bob goes to
Trudy. Trudy can now mount a man-in-the-middle attack without having to go to
the trouble of tapping any phone lines. Instead, she has to break into a DNS ser-
ver and change one record, a much easier proposition.
How might Trudy fool DNS? It turns out to be relatively easy. Briefly sum-
marized, Trudy can trick the DNS server at Alice’s ISP into sending out a query
to look up Bob’s address. Unfortunately, since DNS uses UDP, the DNS server
has no real way of checking who supplied the answer. Trudy can exploit this
property by forging the expected reply and thus injecting a false IP address into
the DNS server’s cache. For simplicity, we will assume that Alice’s ISP does not
initially have an entry for Bob’s Web site, bob.com. If it does, Trudy can wait
until it times out and try later (or use other tricks).

Figure 8-46. (a) Normal situation. (b) An attack based on breaking into a DNS
server and modifying Bob’s record.
Trudy starts the attack by sending a lookup request to Alice’s ISP asking for
the IP address of bob.com. Since there is no entry for this DNS name, the cache
server queries the top-level server for the com domain to get one. However,
Trudy beats the com server to the punch and sends back a false reply saying:
‘‘bob.com is 42.9.9.9,’’ where that IP address is hers. If her false reply gets back
to Alice’s ISP first, that one will be cached and the real reply will be rejected as
an unsolicited reply to a query no longer outstanding. Tricking a DNS server into
installing a false IP address is called DNS spoofing. A cache that holds an inten-
tionally false IP address like this is called a poisoned cache.
Actually, things are not quite that simple. First, Alice’s ISP checks to see that
the reply bears the correct IP source address of the top-level server. But since
Trudy can put anything she wants in that IP field, she can defeat that test easily
since the IP addresses of the top-level servers have to be public.
Second, to allow DNS servers to tell which reply goes with which request, all
requests carry a sequence number. To spoof Alice’s ISP, Trudy has to know its
current sequence number. The easiest way to learn the current sequence number
is for Trudy to register a domain herself, say, trudy-the-intruder.com. Let us as-
sume its IP address is also 42.9.9.9. She also creates a DNS server for her newly
hatched domain, dns.trudy-the-intruder.com. It, too, uses Trudy’s 42.9.9.9 IP ad-
dress, since Trudy has only one computer. Now she has to make Alice’s ISP
aware of her DNS server. That is easy to do. All she has to do is ask Alice’s ISP
for foobar.trudy-the-intruder.com, which will cause Alice’s ISP to find out who
serves Trudy’s new domain by asking the top-level com server.

## Page 88

NETWORK SECURITY
CHAP. 8
With dns.trudy-the-intruder.com safely in the cache at Alice’s ISP, the real at-
tack can start. Trudy now queries Alice’s ISP for www.trudy-the-intruder.com.
The ISP naturally sends Trudy’s DNS server a query asking for it. This query
bears the sequence number that Trudy is looking for. Quick like a bunny, Trudy
asks Alice’s ISP to look up Bob. She immediately answers her own question by
sending the ISP a forged reply, allegedly from the top-level com server, saying:
‘‘bob.com is 42.9.9.9’’. This forged reply carries a sequence number one higher
than the one she just received. While she is at it, she can also send a second for-
gery with a sequence number two higher, and maybe a dozen more with increas-
ing sequence numbers. One of them is bound to match. The rest will just be
thrown out. When Alice’s forged reply arrives, it is cached; when the real reply
comes in later, it is rejected since no query is then outstanding.
Now when Alice looks up bob.com, she is told to use 42.9.9.9, Trudy’s ad-
dress. Trudy has mounted a successful man-in-the-middle attack from the com-
fort of her own living room. The various steps to this attack are illustrated in
Fig. 8-47. This one specific attack can be foiled by having DNS servers use ran-
dom IDs in their queries rather than just counting, but it seems that every time one
hole is plugged, another one turns up. In particular, the IDs are only 16 bits, so
working through all of them is easy when it is a computer that is doing the guess-
ing.
1. Look up foobar.trudy-the-intruder.com
(to force it into the ISP's cache)
2. Look up www.trudy-the-intruder.com

(to force the ISP to query the com server in step 5)

Secure DNS
The real problem is that DNS was designed at a time when the Internet was a
research facility for a few hundred universities, and neither Alice, nor Bob, nor
Trudy was invited to the party. Security was not an issue then; making the Inter-
net work at all was the issue. The environment has changed radically over the

years, so in 1994 IETF set up a working group to make DNS fundamentally se-
cure. This (ongoing) project is known as DNSsec (DNS security); its first output
was presented in RFC 2535. Unfortunately, DNSsec has not been fully deployed
yet, so numerous DNS servers are still vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
DNSsec is conceptually extremely simple. It is based on public-key crypto-
graphy. Every DNS zone (in the sense of Fig. 7-5) has a public/private key pair.
All information sent by a DNS server is signed with the originating zone’s private
key, so the receiver can verify its authenticity.
DNSsec offers three fundamental services:
1. Proof of where the data originated.
2. Public key distribution.
3. Transaction and request authentication.
The main service is the first one, which verifies that the data being returned has
been approved by the zone’s owner. The second one is useful for storing and
retrieving public keys securely. The third one is needed to guard against playback
and spoofing attacks. Note that secrecy is not an offered service since all the
information in DNS is considered public. Since phasing in DNSsec is expected to
take several years, the ability for security-aware servers to interwork with securi-
ty-ignorant servers is essential, which implies that the protocol cannot be changed.
Let us now look at some of the details.
DNS records are grouped into sets called RRSets (Resource Record Sets),
with all the records having the same name, class, and type being lumped together
in a set. An RRSet may contain multiple A records, for example, if a DNS name
resolves to a primary IP address and a secondary IP address. The RRSets are ex-
tended with several new record types (discussed below). Each RRSet is crypto-
graphically hashed (e.g., using SHA-1). The hash is signed by the zone’s private
key (e.g., using RSA). The unit of transmission to clients is the signed RRSet.
Upon receipt of a signed RRSet, the client can verify whether it was signed by the
private key of the originating zone. If the signature agrees, the data are accepted.
Since each RRSet contains its own signature, RRSets can be cached anywhere,
even at untrustworthy servers, without endangering the security.
DNSsec introduces several new record types. The first of these is the KEY
record. This records holds the public key of a zone, user, host, or other principal,
the cryptographic algorithm used for signing, the protocol used for transmission,
and a few other bits. The public key is stored naked. X.509 certificates are not
used due to their bulk. The algorithm field holds a 1 for MD5/RSA signatures
(the preferred choice), and other values for other combinations. The protocol
field can indicate the use of IPsec or other security protocols, if any.
The second new record type is the SIG record. It holds the signed hash
according to the algorithm specified in the KEY record. The signature applies to
all the records in the RRSet, including any KEY records present, but excluding

---

NETWORK SECURITY
CHAP. 8
itself. It also holds the times when the signature begins its period of validity and
when it expires, as well as the signer’s name and a few other items.
The DNSsec design is such that a zone’s private key can be kept offline.
Once or twice a day, the contents of a zone’s database can be manually tran-
sported (e.g., on CD-ROM) to a disconnected machine on which the private key is
located. All the RRSets can be signed there and the SIG records thus produced
can be conveyed back to the zone’s primary server on CD-ROM. In this way, the
private key can be stored on a CD-ROM locked in a safe except when it is insert-
ed into the disconnected machine for signing the day’s new RRSets. After signing
is completed, all copies of the key are erased from memory and the disk and the
CD-ROM are returned to the safe. This procedure reduces electronic security to
physical security, something people understand how to deal with.
This method of presigning RRSets greatly speeds up the process of answering
queries since no cryptography has to be done on the fly. The trade-off is that a
large amount of disk space is needed to store all the keys and signatures in the
DNS databases. Some records will increase tenfold in size due to the signature.
When a client process gets a signed RRSet, it must apply the originating
zone’s public key to decrypt the hash, compute the hash itself, and compare the
two values. If they agree, the data are considered valid. However, this procedure
begs the question of how the client gets the zone’s public key. One way is to ac-
quire it from a trusted server, using a secure connection (e.g., using IPsec).
However, in practice, it is expected that clients will be preconfigured with the
public keys of all the top-level domains. If Alice now wants to visit Bob’s Web
site, she can ask DNS for the RRSet of bob.com, which will contain his IP address
and a KEY record containing Bob’s public key. This RRSet will be signed by the
top-level com domain, so Alice can easily verify its validity. An example of what
this RRSet might contain is shown in Fig. 8-48.

key. The SIG record is the top-level com server’s signed hash of the A and KEY
records to verify their authenticity.
Now armed with a verified copy of Bob’s public key, Alice can ask Bob’s
DNS server (run by Bob) for the IP address of www.bob.com. This RRSet will be
signed by Bob’s private key, so Alice can verify the signature on the RRSet Bob
returns. If Trudy somehow manages to inject a false RRSet into any of the
caches, Alice can easily detect its lack of authenticity because the SIG record con-
tained in it will be incorrect.

However, DNSsec also provides a cryptographic mechanism to bind a re-
sponse to a specific query, to prevent the kind of spoof Trudy managed to pull off
in Fig. 8-47. This (optional) antispoofing measure adds to the response a hash of
the query message signed with the respondent’s private key. Since Trudy does
not know the private key of the top-level com server, she cannot forge a response
to a query Alice’s ISP sent there. She can certainly get her response back first,
but it will be rejected due to its invalid signature over the hashed query.
DNSsec also supports a few other record types. For example, the CERT
record can be used for storing (e.g., X.509) certificates. This record has been pro-
vided because some people want to turn DNS into a PKI. Whether this will ac-
tually happen remains to be seen. We will stop our discussion of DNSsec here.

8.9.3 SSL—The Secure Sockets Layer
Secure naming is a good start, but there is much more to Web security. The
next step is secure connections. We will now look at how secure connections can
be achieved. Nothing involving security is simple and this is not either.
When the Web burst into public view, it was initially used for just distributing
static pages. However, before long, some companies got the idea of using it for
financial transactions, such as purchasing merchandise by credit card, online
banking, and electronic stock trading. These applications created a demand for
secure connections. In 1995, Netscape Communications Corp., the then-dominant
browser vendor, responded by introducing a security package called SSL (Secure
Sockets Layer) to meet this demand. This software and its protocol are now
widely used, for example, by Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer, so it is worth
examining in some detail.
SSL builds a secure connection between two sockets, including
1. Parameter negotiation between client and server.
2. Authentication of the server by the client.
3. Secret communication.
4. Data integrity protection.
We have seen these items before, so there is no need to elaborate on them.
The positioning of SSL in the usual protocol stack is illustrated in Fig. 8-49.
Effectively, it is a new layer interposed between the application layer and the
transport layer, accepting requests from the browser and sending them down to
TCP for transmission to the server. Once the secure connection has been estab-
lished, SSL’s main job is handling compression and encryption. When HTTP is
used over SSL, it is called HTTPS (Secure HTTP), even though it is the standard
HTTP protocol. Sometimes it is available at a new port (443) instead of port 80.

As an aside, SSL is not restricted to Web browsers, but that is its most common
application. It can also provide mutual authentication.

Figure 8-49. Layers (and protocols) for a home user browsing with SSL.
The SSL protocol has gone through several versions. Below we will discuss
only version 3, which is the most widely used version. SSL supports a variety of
different options. These options include the presence or absence of compression,
the cryptographic algorithms to be used, and some matters relating to export res-
trictions on cryptography. The last is mainly intended to make sure that serious
cryptography is used only when both ends of the connection are in the United
States. In other cases, keys are limited to 40 bits, which cryptographers regard as
something of a joke. Netscape was forced to put in this restriction in order to get
an export license from the U.S. Government.
SSL consists of two subprotocols, one for establishing a secure connection
and one for using it. Let us start out by seeing how secure connections are estab-
lished. The connection establishment subprotocol is shown in Fig. 8-50. It starts
out with message 1 when Alice sends a request to Bob to establish a connection.
The request specifies the SSL version Alice has and her preferences with respect
to compression and cryptographic algorithms. It also contains a nonce, RA, to be
used later.
Now it is Bob’s turn. In message 2, Bob makes a choice among the various
algorithms that Alice can support and sends his own nonce, RB. Then, in message
3, he sends a certificate containing his public key. If this certificate is not signed
by some well-known authority, he also sends a chain of certificates that can be
followed back to one. All browsers, including Alice’s, come preloaded with
about 100 public keys, so if Bob can establish a chain anchored to one of these,
Alice will be able to verify Bob’s public key. At this point, Bob may send some
other messages (such as a request for Alice’s public-key certificate). When Bob
is done, he sends message 4 to tell Alice it is her turn.
Alice responds by choosing a random 384-bit premaster key and sending it
to Bob encrypted with his public key (message 5). The actual session key used
for encrypting data is derived from the premaster key combined with both nonces
in a complex way. After message 5 has been received, both Alice and Bob are
able to compute the session key. For this reason, Alice tells Bob to switch to the

new cipher (message 6) and also that she is finished with the establishment
subprotocol (message 7). Bob then acknowledges her (messages 8 and 9).
However, although Alice knows who Bob is, Bob does not know who Alice is
(unless Alice has a public key and a corresponding certificate for it, an unlikely
situation for an individual). Therefore, Bob’s first message may well be a request
for Alice to log in using a previously established login name and password. The
login protocol, however, is outside the scope of SSL. Once it has been accom-
plished, by whatever means, data transport can begin.
As mentioned above, SSL supports multiple cryptographic algorithms. The
strongest one uses triple DES with three separate keys for encryption and SHA-1
for message integrity. This combination is relatively slow, so it is mostly used for
banking and other applications in which the highest security is required. For or-
dinary e-commerce applications, RC4 is used with a 128-bit key for encryption
and MD5 is used for message authentication. RC4 takes the 128-bit key as a seed
and expands it to a much larger number for internal use. Then it uses this internal
number to generate a keystream. The keystream is XORed with the plaintext to
provide a classical stream cipher, as we saw in Fig. 8-14. The export versions
also use RC4 with 128-bit keys, but 88 of the bits are made public to make the
cipher easy to break.
For actual transport, a second subprotocol is used, as shown in Fig. 8-51.
Messages from the browser are first broken into units of up to 16 KB. If data

compression is enabled, each unit is then separately compressed. After that, a
secret key derived from the two nonces and premaster key is concatenated with
the compressed text and the result is hashed with the agreed-on hashing algorithm
(usually MD5). This hash is appended to each fragment as the MAC. The
compressed fragment plus MAC is then encrypted with the agreed-on symmetric
encryption algorithm (usually by XORing it with the RC4 keystream). Finally, a
fragment header is attached and the fragment is transmitted over the TCP con-
nection.

A word of caution is in order, however. Since it has been shown that RC4 has
some weak keys that can be easily cryptanalyzed, the security of SSL using RC4
is on shaky ground (Fluhrer et al., 2001). Browsers that allow the user to choose
the cipher suite should be configured to use triple DES with 168-bit keys and
SHA-1 all the time, even though this combination is slower than RC4 and MD5.
Or, better yet, users should upgrade to browsers that support the successor to SSL
that we describe shortly.
A problem with SSL is that the principals may not have certificates, and even
if they do, they do not always verify that the keys being used match them.
In 1996, Netscape Communications Corp. turned SSL over to IETF for stan-
dardization. The result was TLS (Transport Layer Security). It is described in
RFC 5246.
TLS was built on SSL version 3. The changes made to SSL were relatively
small, but just enough that SSL version 3 and TLS cannot interoperate. For ex-
ample, the way the session key is derived from the premaster key and nonces was

changed to make the key stronger (i.e., harder to cryptanalyze). Because of this
incompatibility, most browsers implement both protocols, with TLS falling back
to SSL during negotiation if necessary. This is referred to as SSL/TLS. The first
TLS implementation appeared in 1999 with version 1.2 defined in August 2008.
It includes support for stronger cipher suites (notably AES). SSL has remained
strong in the marketplace although TLS will probably gradually replace it.
8.9.4 Mobile Code Security
Naming and connections are two areas of concern related to Web security.
But there are more. In the early days, when Web pages were just static HTML
files, they did not contain executable code. Now they often contain small pro-
grams, including Java applets, ActiveX controls, and JavaScripts. Downloading
and executing such mobile code is obviously a massive security risk, so various
methods have been devised to minimize it. We will now take a quick peek at
some of the issues raised by mobile code and some approaches to dealing with it.
Java Applet Security
Java applets are small Java programs compiled to a stack-oriented machine
language called JVM (Java Virtual Machine). They can be placed on a Web
page for downloading along with the page. After the page is loaded, the applets
are inserted into a JVM interpreter inside the browser, as illustrated in Fig. 8-52.

Figure 8-52. Applets can be interpreted by a Web browser.
The advantage of running interpreted code over compiled code is that every
instruction is examined by the interpreter before being executed. This gives the
interpreter the opportunity to check whether the instruction’s address is valid. In
addition, system calls are also caught and interpreted. How these calls are hand-
led is a matter of the security policy. For example, if an applet is trusted (e.g., it

---

## Page 96

858
NETWORK SECURITY
CHAP. 8
came from the local disk), its system calls could be carried out without question.
However, if an applet is not trusted (e.g., it came in over the Internet), it could be
encapsulated in what is called a sandbox to restrict its behavior and trap its at-
tempts to use system resources.
When an applet tries to use a system resource, its call is passed to a security
monitor for approval. The monitor examines the call in light of the local security
policy and then makes a decision to allow or reject it. In this way, it is possible to
give applets access to some resources but not all. Unfortunately, the reality is that
the security model works badly and that bugs in it crop up all the time.
ActiveX
ActiveX controls are x86 binary programs that can be embedded in Web
pages. When one of them is encountered, a check is made to see if it should be
executed, and it if passes the test, it is executed. It is not interpreted or sandboxed
in any way, so it has as much power as any other user program and can potentially
do great harm. Thus, all the security is in the decision whether to run the ActiveX
control. In retrospect, the whole idea is a gigantic security hole.
The method that Microsoft chose for making this decision is based on the idea
of code signing. Each ActiveX control is accompanied by a digital signature—a
hash of the code that is signed by its creator using public-key cryptography.
When an ActiveX control shows up, the browser first verifies the signature to
make sure it has not been tampered with in transit. If the signature is correct, the
browser then checks its internal tables to see if the program’s creator is trusted or
there is a chain of trust back to a trusted creator. If the creator is trusted, the pro-
gram is executed; otherwise, it is not. The Microsoft system for verifying Ac-
tiveX controls is called Authenticode.
It is useful to contrast the Java and ActiveX approaches. With the Java ap-
proach, no attempt is made to determine who wrote the applet. Instead, a run-time
interpreter makes sure it does not do things the machine owner has said applets
may not do. In contrast, with code signing, there is no attempt to monitor the
mobile code’s run-time behavior. If it came from a trusted source and has not
been modified in transit, it just runs. No attempt is made to see whether the code
is malicious or not. If the original programmer intended the code to format the
hard disk and then erase the flash ROM so the computer can never again be
booted, and if the programmer has been certified as trusted, the code will be run
and destroy the computer (unless ActiveX controls have been disabled in the
browser).
Many people feel that trusting an unknown software company is scary. To
demonstrate the problem, a programmer in Seattle formed a software company
and got it certified as trustworthy, which is easy to do. He then wrote an ActiveX
control that did a clean shutdown of the machine and distributed his ActiveX con-
trol widely. It shut down many machines, but they could just be rebooted, so no

859
harm was done. He was just trying to expose the problem to the world. The of-
ficial response was to revoke the certificate for this specific ActiveX control,
which ended a short episode of acute embarrassment, but the underlying problem
is still there for an evil programmer to exploit (Garfinkel with Spafford, 2002).
Since there is no way to police the thousands of software companies that might
write mobile code, the technique of code signing is a disaster waiting to happen.
JavaScript
JavaScript does not have any formal security model, but it does have a long
history of leaky implementations. Each vendor handles security in a different
way. For example, Netscape Navigator version 2 used something akin to the Java
model, but by version 4 that had been abandoned for a code-signing model.
The fundamental problem is that letting foreign code run on your machine is
asking for trouble. From a security standpoint, it is like inviting a burglar into
your house and then trying to watch him carefully so he cannot escape from the
kitchen into the living room. If something unexpected happens and you are dis-
tracted for a moment, bad things can happen. The tension here is that mobile code
allows flashy graphics and fast interaction, and many Web site designers think
that this is much more important than security, especially when it is somebody
else’s machine at risk.
Browser Extensions
As well as extending Web pages with code, there is a booming marketplace in
browser extensions, add-ons, and plug-ins. They are computer programs that
extend the functionality of Web browsers. Plug-ins often provide the capability to
interpret or display a certain type of content, such as PDFs or Flash animations.
Extensions and add-ons provide new browser features, such as better password
management, or ways to interact with pages by, for example, marking them up or
enabling easy shopping for related items.
Installing an extension, add-on, or plug-in is as simple as coming across
something you want when browsing and following the link to install the program.
This action will cause code to be downloaded across the Internet and installed into
the browser. All of these programs are written to frameworks that differ depend-
ing on the browser that is being enhanced. However, to a first approximation, they
become part of the trusted computing base of the browser. That is, if the code that
is installed is buggy, the entire browser can be compromised.
There are two other obvious failure modes as well. The first is that the pro-
gram may behave maliciously, for example, by gathering personal information
and sending it to a remote server. For all the browser knows, the user installed the
extension for precisely this purpose. The second problem is that plug-ins give the
browser the ability to interpret new types of content. Often this content is a full

## Page 98

blown programming language itself. PDF and Flash are good examples. When
users view pages with PDF and Flash content, the plug-ins in their browser are ex-
ecuting the PDF and Flash code. That code had better be safe; often there are vul-
nerabilities that it can exploit. For all of these reasons, add-ons and plug-ins
should only be installed as needed and only from trusted vendors.
Viruses
Viruses are another form of mobile code. Only, unlike the examples above,
viruses are not invited in at all. The difference between a virus and ordinary
mobile code is that viruses are written to reproduce themselves. When a virus ar-
rives, either via a Web page, an email attachment, or some other way, it usually
starts out by infecting executable programs on the disk. When one of these pro-
grams is run, control is transferred to the virus, which usually tries to spread itself
to other machines, for example, by emailing copies of itself to everyone in the
victim’s email address book. Some viruses infect the boot sector of the hard disk,
so when the machine is booted, the virus gets to run. Viruses have become a huge
problem on the Internet and have caused billions of dollars’ worth of damage.
There is no obvious solution. Perhaps a whole new generation of operating sys-
tems based on secure microkernels and tight compartmentalization of users, proc-
esses, and resources might help.
8.10 SOCIAL ISSUES
The Internet and its security technology is an area where social issues, public
policy, and technology meet head on, often with huge consequences. Below we
will just briefly examine three areas: privacy, freedom of speech, and copyright.
Needless to say, we can only scratch the surface. For additional reading, see
Anderson (2008a), Garfinkel with Spafford (2002), and Schneier (2004). The In-
ternet is also full of material. Just type words such as ‘‘privacy,’’ ‘‘censorship,’’
and ‘‘copyright’’ into any search engine. Also, see this book’s Web site for some
links. It is at http://www.pearsonhighered.com/tanenbaum.
8.10.1 Privacy
Do people have a right to privacy? Good question. The Fourth Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution prohibits the government from searching people’s houses,
papers, and effects without good reason, and goes on to restrict the circumstances
under which search warrants shall be issued. Thus, privacy has been on the public
agenda for over 200 years, at least in the U.S.
What has changed in the past decade is both the ease with which governments
can spy on their citizens and the ease with which the citizens can prevent such

---

## Page 99

SEC. 8.10
SOCIAL ISSUES
861
spying. In the 18th century, for the government to search a citizen’s papers, it had
to send out a policeman on a horse to go to the citizen’s farm demanding to see
certain documents. It was a cumbersome procedure. Nowadays, telephone com-
panies and Internet providers readily provide wiretaps when presented with search
warrants. It makes life much easier for the policeman and there is no danger of
falling off a horse.
Cryptography changes all that. Anybody who goes to the trouble of down-
loading and installing PGP and who uses a well-guarded alien-strength key can be
fairly sure that nobody in the known universe can read his email, search warrant
or no search warrant. Governments well understand this and do not like it. Real
privacy means it is much harder for them to spy on criminals of all stripes, but it is
also much harder to spy on journalists and political opponents. Consequently,
some governments restrict or forbid the use or export of cryptography. In France,
for example, prior to 1999, all cryptography was banned unless the government
was given the keys.
France was not alone. In April 1993, the U.S. Government announced its
intention to make a hardware cryptoprocessor, the clipper chip, the standard for
all networked communication. It was said that this would guarantee citizens’ pri-
vacy. It also mentioned that the chip provided the government with the ability to
decrypt all traffic via a scheme called key escrow, which allowed the government
access to all the keys. However, the government promised only to snoop when it
had a valid search warrant. Needless to say, a huge furor ensued, with privacy
advocates denouncing the whole plan and law enforcement officials praising it.
Eventually, the government backed down and dropped the idea.
A large amount of information about electronic privacy is available at the
Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Web site, www.eff.org.
Anonymous Remailers
PGP, SSL, and other technologies make it possible for two parties to establish
secure, authenticated communication, free from third-party surveillance and inter-
ference. However, sometimes privacy is best served by not having authentication,
in fact, by making communication anonymous. The anonymity may be desired
for point-to-point messages, newsgroups, or both.
Let us consider some examples. First, political dissidents living under author-
itarian regimes often wish to communicate anonymously to escape being jailed or
killed. Second, wrongdoing in many corporate, educational, governmental, and
other organizations has often been exposed by whistleblowers, who frequently
prefer to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. Third, people with unpopular
social, political, or religious views may wish to communicate with each other via
email or newsgroups without exposing themselves. Fourth, people may wish to
discuss alcoholism, mental illness, sexual harassment, child abuse, or being a

member of a persecuted minority in a newsgroup without having to go public.
Numerous other examples exist, of course.
Let us consider a specific example. In the 1990s, some critics of a nontradi-
tional religious group posted their views to a USENET newsgroup via an
anonymous remailer. This server allowed users to create pseudonyms and send
email to the server, which then remailed or re-posted them using the pseudonyms,
so no one could tell where the messages really came from. Some postings reveal-
ed what the religious group claimed were trade secrets and copyrighted docu-
ments. The religious group responded by telling local authorities that its trade
secrets had been disclosed and its copyright infringed, both of which were crimes
where the server was located. A court case followed and the server operator was
compelled to turn over the mapping information that revealed the true identities of
the persons who had made the postings. (Incidentally, this was not the first time
that a religious group was unhappy when someone leaked its trade secrets: Wil-
liam Tyndale was burned at the stake in 1536 for translating the Bible into Eng-
lish).
A substantial segment of the Internet community was completely outraged by
this breach of confidentiality. The conclusion that everyone drew is that an
anonymous remailer that stores a mapping between real email addresses and pseu-
donyms (now called a type 1 remailer) is not worth much. This case stimulated
various people into designing anonymous remailers that could withstand subpoena
attacks.
These new remailers, often called cypherpunk remailers, work as follows.
The user produces an email message, complete with RFC 822 headers (except
From:, of course), encrypts it with the remailer’s public key, and sends it to the
remailer. There the outer RFC 822 headers are stripped off, the content is de-
crypted and the message is remailed. The remailer has no accounts and maintains
no logs, so even if the server is later confiscated, it retains no trace of messages
that have passed through it.
Many users who wish anonymity chain their requests through multiple
anonymous remailers, as shown in Fig. 8-53. Here, Alice wants to send Bob a
really, really, really anonymous Valentine’s Day card, so she uses three remailers.
She composes the message, M, and puts a header on it containing Bob’s email ad-
dress. Then she encrypts the whole thing with remailer 3’s public key, E 3 (indi-
cated by horizontal hatching). To this she prepends a header with remailer 3’s
email address in plaintext. This is the message shown between remailers 2 and 3
in the figure.
Then she encrypts this message with remailer 2’s public key, E 2 (indicated by
vertical hatching) and prepends a plaintext header containing remailer 2’s email
address. This message is shown between 1 and 2 in Fig. 8-53. Finally, she en-
crypts the entire message with remailer 1’s public key, E 1, and prepends a plain-
text header with remailer 1’s email address. This is the message shown to the
right of Alice in the figure and this is the message she actually transmits.

Figure 8-53. How Alice uses three remailers to send Bob a message.
When the message hits remailer 1, the outer header is stripped off. The body
is decrypted and then emailed to remailer 2. Similar steps occur at the other two
remailers.
Although it is extremely difficult for anyone to trace the final message back to
Alice, many remailers take additional safety precautions. For example, they may
hold messages for a random time, add or remove junk at the end of a message, and
reorder messages, all to make it harder for anyone to tell which message output by
a remailer corresponds to which input, in order to thwart traffic analysis. For a
description of this kind of remailer, see Mazie`res and Kaashoek (1998).
Anonymity is not restricted to email.
Services also exist that allow
anonymous Web surfing using the same form of layered path in which one node
only knows the next node in the chain. This method is called onion routing be-
cause each node peels off another layer of the onion to determine where to for-
ward the packet next. The user configures his browser to use the anonymizer ser-
vice as a proxy. Tor is a well-known example of such a system (Dingledine et al.,
2004). Henceforth, all HTTP requests go through the anonymizer network, which
requests the page and sends it back. The Web site sees an exit node of the
anonymizer network as the source of the request, not the user. As long as the
anonymizer network refrains from keeping a log, after the fact no one can deter-
mine who requested which page.
8.10.2 Freedom of Speech
Privacy relates to individuals wanting to restrict what other people can see
about them. A second key social issue is freedom of speech, and its opposite,
censorship, which is about governments wanting to restrict what individuals can
read and publish. With the Web containing millions and millions of pages, it has
become a censor’s paradise. Depending on the nature and ideology of the regime,
banned material may include Web sites containing any of the following:

---

## Page 102

864

CHAP. 8
1. Material inappropriate for children or teenagers.
2. Hate aimed at various ethnic, religious, sexual or other groups.
3. Information about democracy and democratic values.
4. Accounts of historical events contradicting the government’s version.
5. Manuals for picking locks, building weapons, encrypting messages, etc.
The usual response is to ban the ‘‘bad’’ sites.
Sometimes the results are unexpected. For example, some public libraries
have installed Web filters on their computers to make them child friendly by
blocking pornography sites. The filters veto sites on their blacklists but also
check pages for dirty words before displaying them. In one case in Loudoun
County, Virginia, the filter blocked a patron’s search for information on breast
cancer because the filter saw the word ‘‘breast.’’ The library patron sued Loudoun
County. However, in Livermore, California, a parent sued the public library for
not installing a filter after her 12-year-old son was caught viewing pornography
there. What’s a library to do?
It has escaped many people that the World Wide Web is a worldwide Web. It
covers the whole world. Not all countries agree on what should be allowed on the
Web. For example, in November 2000, a French court ordered Yahoo!, a Califor-
nia Corporation, to block French users from viewing auctions of Nazi memorabi-
lia on Yahoo!’s Web site because owning such material violates French law.
Yahoo! appealed to a U.S. court, which sided with it, but the issue of whose laws
apply where is far from settled.
Just imagine. What would happen if some court in Utah instructed France to
block Web sites dealing with wine because they do not comply with Utah’s much
stricter laws about alcohol? Suppose that China demanded that all Web sites
dealing with democracy be banned as not in the interest of the State. Do Iranian
laws on religion apply to more liberal Sweden? Can Saudi Arabia block Web
sites dealing with women’s rights? The whole issue is a veritable Pandora’s box.
A relevant comment from John Gilmore is: ‘‘The net interprets censorship as
damage and routes around it.’’ For a concrete implementation, consider the eter-
nity service (Anderson, 1996). Its goal is to make sure published information
cannot be depublished or rewritten, as was common in the Soviet Union during
Josef Stalin’s reign. To use the eternity service, the user specifies how long the
material is to be preserved, pays a fee proportional to its duration and size, and
uploads it. Thereafter, no one can remove or edit it, not even the uploader.
How could such a service be implemented? The simplest model is to use a
peer-to-peer system in which stored documents would be placed on dozens of par-
ticipating servers, each of which gets a fraction of the fee, and thus an incentive to
join the system. The servers should be spread over many legal jurisdictions for
maximum resilience. Lists of 10 randomly selected servers would be stored

securely in multiple places, so that if some were compromised, others would still
exist. An authority bent on destroying the document could never be sure it had
found all copies. The system could also be made self-repairing in the sense that if
it became known that some copies had been destroyed, the remaining sites would
attempt to find new repositories to replace them.
The eternity service was the first proposal for a censorship-resistant system.
Since then, others have been proposed and, in some cases, implemented. Various
new features have been added, such as encryption, anonymity, and fault tolerance.
Often the files to be stored are broken up into multiple fragments, with each frag-
ment stored on many servers. Some of these systems are Freenet (Clarke et al.,
2002), PASIS (Wylie et al., 2000), and Publius (Waldman et al., 2000). Other
work is reported by Serjantov (2002).
Increasingly, many countries are trying to regulate the export of intangibles,
which often include Web sites, software, scientific papers, email, telephone help-
desks, and more. Even the U.K., which has a centuries-long tradition of freedom
of speech, is now seriously considering highly restrictive laws, that would, for ex-
ample, define technical discussions between a British professor and his foreign
Ph.D. student, both located at the University of Cambridge, as regulated export
needing a government license (Anderson, 2002). Needless to say, many people
consider such a policy to be outrageous.
Steganography
In countries where censorship abounds, dissidents often try to use technology
to evade it. Cryptography allows secret messages to be sent (although possibly
not lawfully), but if the government thinks that Alice is a Bad Person, the mere
fact that she is communicating with Bob may get him put in this category, too, as
repressive governments understand the concept of transitive closure, even if they
are short on mathematicians.
Anonymous remailers can help, but if they are
banned domestically and messages to foreign ones require a government export
license, they cannot help much. But the Web can.
People who want to communicate secretly often try to hide the fact that any
communication at all is taking place. The science of hiding messages is called
steganography, from the Greek words for ‘‘covered writing.’’ In fact, the ancient
Greeks used it themselves. Herodotus wrote of a general who shaved the head of
a messenger, tattooed a message on his scalp, and let the hair grow back before
sending him off. Modern techniques are conceptually the same, only they have a
higher bandwidth, lower latency, and do not require the services of a barber.
As a case in point, consider Fig. 8-54(a). This photograph, taken by one of
the authors (AST) in Kenya, contains three zebras contemplating an acacia tree.
Fig. 8-54(b) appears to be the same three zebras and acacia tree, but it has an
extra added attraction.
It contains the complete, unabridged text of five of

Shakespeare’s plays embedded in it: Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, The Merchant
of Venice, and Julius Caesar. Together, these plays total over 700 KB of text.

How does this steganographic channel work? The original color image is
1024 × 768 pixels. Each pixel consists of three 8-bit numbers, one each for the
red, green, and blue intensity of that pixel. The pixel’s color is formed by the
linear superposition of the three colors. The steganographic encoding method
uses the low-order bit of each RGB color value as a covert channel. Thus, each
pixel has room for 3 bits of secret information, 1 in the red value, 1 in the green
value, and 1 in the blue value. With an image of this size, up to 1024 × 768 × 3
bits or 294,912 bytes of secret information can be stored in it.
The full text of the five plays and a short notice add up to 734,891 bytes. This
text was first compressed to about 274 KB using a standard compression algo-
rithm. The compressed output was then encrypted using IDEA and inserted into
the low-order bits of each color value. As can be seen (or actually, cannot be
seen), the existence of the information is completely invisible. It is equally invisi-
ble in the large, full-color version of the photo. The eye cannot easily distinguish
21-bit color from 24-bit color.
Viewing the two images in black and white with low resolution does not do
justice to how powerful the technique is. To get a better feel for how steganogra-
phy works, we have prepared a demonstration, including the full-color high-
resolution image of Fig. 8-54(b) with the five plays embedded in it. The demons-
tration, including tools for inserting and extracting text into images, can be found
at the book’s Web site.
To use steganography for undetected communication, dissidents could create
a Web site bursting with politically correct pictures, such as photographs of the
Great Leader, local sports, movie, and television stars, etc. Of course, the pictures
would be riddled with steganographic messages.
If the messages were first

compressed and then encrypted, even someone who suspected their presence
would have immense difficulty in distinguishing the messages from white noise.
Of course, the images should be fresh scans; copying a picture from the Internet
and changing some of the bits is a dead giveaway.
Images are by no means the only carrier for steganographic messages. Audio
files also work fine. Hidden information can be carried in a voice-over-IP call by
manipulating the packet delays, distorting the audio, or even in the header fields
of packets (Lubacz et al., 2010). Even the layout and ordering of tags in an
HTML file can carry information.
Although we have examined steganography in the context of free speech, it
has numerous other uses. One common use is for the owners of images to encode
secret messages in them stating their ownership rights. If such an image is stolen
and placed on a Web site, the lawful owner can reveal the steganographic mes-
sage in court to prove whose image it is. This technique is called watermarking.
It is discussed in Piva et al. (2002).
For more on steganography, see Wayner (2008).
8.10.3 Copyright
Privacy and censorship are just two areas where technology meets public poli-
cy. A third one is the copyright law. Copyright is granting to the creators of IP
(Intellectual Property), including writers, poets, artists, composers, musicians,
photographers, cinematographers, choreographers, and others, the exclusive right
to exploit their IP for some period of time, typically the life of the author plus 50
years or 75 years in the case of corporate ownership. After the copyright of a
work expires, it passes into the public domain and anyone can use or sell it as they
wish. The Gutenberg Project (www.promo.net/pg), for example, has placed thou-
sands of public-domain works (e.g., by Shakespeare, Twain, and Dickens) on the
Web. In 1998, the U.S. Congress extended copyright in the U.S. by another 20
years at the request of Hollywood, which claimed that without an extension
nobody would create anything any more. By way of contrast, patents last for only
20 years and people still invent things.
Copyright came to the forefront when Napster, a music-swapping service, had
50 million members. Although Napster did not actually copy any music, the
courts held that its holding a central database of who had which song was contri-
butory infringement, that is, it was helping other people infringe. While nobody
seriously claims copyright is a bad idea (although many claim that the term is far
too long, favoring big corporations over the public), the next generation of music
sharing is already raising major ethical issues.
For example, consider a peer-to-peer network in which people share legal
files (public-domain music, home videos, religious tracts that are not trade secrets,
etc.) and perhaps a few that are copyrighted. Assume that everyone is online all
the time via ADSL or cable. Each machine has an index of what is on the hard

disk, plus a list of other members. Someone looking for a specific item can pick a
random member and see if he has it. If not, he can check out all the members in
that person’s list, and all the members in their lists, and so on. Computers are
very good at this kind of work. Having found the item, the requester just copies it.
If the work is copyrighted, chances are the requester is infringing (although
for international transfers, the question of whose law applies matters because in
some countries uploading is illegal but downloading is not). But what about the
supplier? Is it a crime to keep music you have paid for and legally downloaded on
your hard disk where others might find it? If you have an unlocked cabin in the
country and an IP thief sneaks in carrying a notebook computer and scanner, scans
a copyrighted book to the notebook’s hard disk, and sneaks out, are you guilty of
the crime of failing to protect someone else’s copyright?
But there is more trouble brewing on the copyright front. There is a huge bat-
tle going on now between Hollywood and the computer industry. The former
wants stringent protection of all intellectual property but the latter does not want
to be Hollywood’s policeman. In October 1998, Congress passed the DMCA
(Digital Millennium Copyright Act), which makes it a crime to circumvent any
protection mechanism present in a copyrighted work or to tell others how to cir-
cumvent it. Similar legislation has been enacted in the European Union. While
virtually no one thinks that pirates in the Far East should be allowed to duplicate
copyrighted works, many people think that the DMCA completely shifts the bal-
ance between the copyright owner’s interest and the public interest.
A case in point: in September 2000, a music industry consortium charged with
building an unbreakable system for selling music online sponsored a contest invit-
ing people to try to break the system (which is precisely the right thing to do with
any new security system). A team of security researchers from several universi-
ties, led by Prof. Edward Felten of Princeton, took up the challenge and broke the
system.
They then wrote a paper about their findings and submitted it to a
USENIX security conference, where it underwent peer review and was accepted.
Before the paper was to be presented, Felten received a letter from the Recording
Industry Association of America that threatened to sue the authors under the
DMCA if they published the paper.
Their response was to file a lawsuit asking a federal court to rule on whether
publishing scientific papers on security research was still legal. Fearing a defini-
tive court ruling against it, the industry withdrew its threat and the court dismissed
Felten’s suit. No doubt the industry was motivated by the weakness of its case: it
had invited people to try to break its system and then threatened to sue some of
them for accepting its own challenge. With the threat withdrawn, the paper was
published (Craver et al., 2001). A new confrontation is virtually certain.
Meanwhile, pirated music and movies have fueled the massive growth of
peer-to-peer networks. This has not pleased the copyright holders, who have used
the DMCA to take action. There are now automated systems that search peer-to-
peer networks and then fire off warnings to network operators and users who are

suspected of infringing copyright. In the United States, these warnings are known
as DMCA takedown notices. This search is an arms’ race because it is hard to
reliably catch copyright infringers. Even your printer might be mistaken for a
culprit (Piatek et al., 2008).
A related issue is the extent of the fair use doctrine, which has been estab-
lished by court rulings in various countries. This doctrine says that purchasers of
a copyrighted work have certain limited rights to copy the work, including the
right to quote parts of it for scientific purposes, use it as teaching material in
schools or colleges, and in some cases make backup copies for personal use in
case the original medium fails. The tests for what constitutes fair use include (1)
whether the use is commercial, (2) what percentage of the whole is being copied,
and (3) the effect of the copying on sales of the work. Since the DMCA and simi-
lar laws within the European Union prohibit circumvention of copy protection
schemes, these laws also prohibit legal fair use. In effect, the DMCA takes away
historical rights from users to give content sellers more power. A major show-
down is inevitable.
Another development in the works that dwarfs even the DMCA in its shifting
of the balance between copyright owners and users is trusted computing as
advocated by industry bodies such as the TCG (Trusted Computing Group), led
by companies like Intel and Microsoft. The idea is to provide support for careful-
ly monitoring user behavior in various ways (e.g., playing pirated music) at a level
below the operating system in order to prohibit unwanted behavior.
This is
accomplished with a small chip, called a TPM (Trusted Platform Module),
which it is difficult to tamper with. Most PCs sold nowadays come equipped with
a TPM. The system allows software written by content owners to manipulate PCs
in ways that users cannot change. This raises the question of who is trusted in
trusted computing. Certainly, it is not the user. Needless to say, the social conse-
quences of this scheme are immense. It is nice that the industry is finally paying
attention to security, but it is lamentable that the driver is enforcing copyright law
rather than dealing with viruses, crackers, intruders, and other security issues that
most people are concerned about.
In short, the lawmakers and lawyers will be busy balancing the economic in-
terests of copyright owners with the public interest for years to come. Cyberspace
is no different from meatspace: it constantly pits one group against another, re-
sulting in power struggles, litigation, and (hopefully) eventually some kind of
resolution, at least until some new disruptive technology comes along.
8.11 SUMMARY
Cryptography is a tool that can be used to keep information confidential and
to ensure its integrity and authenticity. All modern cryptographic systems are
based on Kerckhoff’s principle of having a publicly known algorithm and a secret

key. Many cryptographic algorithms use complex transformations involving sub-
stitutions and permutations to transform the plaintext into the ciphertext. Howev-
er, if quantum cryptography can be made practical, the use of one-time pads may
provide truly unbreakable cryptosystems.
Cryptographic algorithms can be divided into symmetric-key algorithms and
public-key algorithms. Symmetric-key algorithms mangle the bits in a series of
rounds parameterized by the key to turn the plaintext into the ciphertext. AES
(Rijndael) and triple DES are the most popular symmetric-key algorithms at pres-
ent. These algorithms can be used in electronic code book mode, cipher block
chaining mode, stream cipher mode, counter mode, and others.
Public-key algorithms have the property that different keys are used for en-
cryption and decryption and that the decryption key cannot be derived from the
encryption key. These properties make it possible to publish the public key. The
main public-key algorithm is RSA, which derives its strength from the fact that it
is very difficult to factor large numbers.
Legal, commercial, and other documents need to be signed. Accordingly, var-
ious schemes have been devised for digital signatures, using both symmetric-key
and public-key algorithms. Commonly, messages to be signed are hashed using
algorithms such as SHA-1, and then the hashes are signed rather than the original
messages.
Public-key management can be done using certificates, which are documents
that bind a principal to a public key. Certificates are signed by a trusted authority
or by someone (recursively) approved by a trusted authority. The root of the
chain has to be obtained in advance, but browsers generally have many root certif-
icates built into them.
These cryptographic tools can be used to secure network traffic. IPsec oper-
ates in the network layer, encrypting packet flows from host to host. Firewalls
can screen traffic going into or out of an organization, often based on the protocol
and port used. Virtual private networks can simulate an old leased-line network
to provide certain desirable security properties. Finally, wireless networks need
good security lest everyone read all the messages, and protocols like 802.11i pro-
vide it.
When two parties establish a session, they have to authenticate each other
and, if need be, establish a shared session key. Various authentication protocols
exist, including some that use a trusted third party, Diffie-Hellman, Kerberos, and
public-key cryptography.
Email security can be achieved by a combination of the techniques we have
studied in this chapter. PGP, for example, compresses messages, then encrypts
them with a secret key and sends the secret key encrypted with the receiver’s pub-
lic key. In addition, it also hashes the message and sends the signed hash to verify
message integrity.
Web security is also an important topic, starting with secure naming. DNSsec
provides a way to prevent DNS spoofing. Most e-commerce Web sites use

SSL/TLS to establish secure, authenticated sessions between the client and server.
Various techniques are used to deal with mobile code, especially sandboxing and
code signing.
The Internet raises many issues in which technology interacts strongly with
public policy. Some of the areas include privacy, freedom of speech, and copy-
right.
PROBLEMS
1. Break the following monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The plaintext, consisting of
letters only, is an excerpt from a poem by Lewis Carroll.

2. An affine cipher is a version of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, in which the let-
ters of an alphabet of size m are first map to the integers in the range 0 to m-1. Subse-
quently, the integer representing each plaintext letter is transformed to an integer
representing the corresponding cipher text letter. The encryption function for a single
letter is E(x) = (ax + b) mod m, where m is the size of the alphabet and a and b are the
key of the cipher, and are co-prime. Trudy finds out that Bob generated a ciphertext
using an affine cipher. She gets a copy of the ciphertext, and finds out that the most
frequent letter of the ciphertext is ’R’, and the second most frequent letter of the
ciphertext is ’K’. Show how Trudy can break the code and retrieve the plaintext.
3. Break the following columnar transposition cipher. The plaintext is taken from a pop-
ular computer textbook, so ‘‘computer’’ is a probable word. The plaintext consists en-
tirely of letters (no spaces). The ciphertext is broken up into blocks of five characters
for readability.

4. Alice used a transposition cipher to encrypt her messages to Bob. For added security,
she encrypted the transposition cipher key using a substitution cipher, and kept the en-
crypted cipher in her computer.
Trudy managed to get hold of the encrypted
transposition cipher key. Can Trudy decipher Alice’s messages to Bob? Why or why
not?
5. Find a 77-bit one-time pad that generates the text ‘‘Hello World’’ from the ciphertext
of Fig. 8-4.

to use Lord of the Rings as a one-time pad. Explain how you could use these assets to
generate an infinitely long one-time pad.
7. Quantum cryptography requires having a photon gun that can, on demand, fire a single
photon carrying 1 bit. In this problem, calculate how many photons a bit carries on a
250-Gbps fiber link. Assume that the length of a photon is equal to its wavelength,
which for purposes of this problem, is 1 micron. The speed of light in fiber is 20
cm/nsec.
8. If Trudy captures and regenerates photons when quantum cryptography is in use, she
will get some of them wrong and cause errors to appear in Bob’s one-time pad. What
fraction of Bob’s one-time pad bits will be in error, on average?
9. A fundamental cryptographic principle states that all messages must have redundancy.
But we also know that redundancy helps an intruder tell if a guessed key is correct.
Consider two forms of redundancy. First, the initial n bits of the plaintext contain a
known pattern. Second, the final n bits of the message contain a hash over the mes-
sage. From a security point of view, are these two equivalent? Discuss your answer.
10. In Fig. 8-6, the P-boxes and S-boxes alternate. Although this arrangement is estheti-
cally pleasing, is it any more secure than first having all the P-boxes and then all the
S-boxes? Discuss your answer.
11. Design an attack on DES based on the knowledge that the plaintext consists
exclusively of uppercase ASCII letters, plus space, comma, period, semicolon, car-
riage return, and line feed. Nothing is known about the plaintext parity bits.
12. In the text, we computed that a cipher-breaking machine with a million processors that
could analyze a key in 1 nanosecond would take 1016 years to break the 128-bit ver-
sion of AES. Let us compute how long it will take for this time to get down to 1 year,
still along time, of course. To achieve this goal, we need computers to be 1016 times
faster. If Moore’s Law (computing power doubles every 18 months) continues to
hold, how many years will it take before a parallel computer can get the cipher-
breaking time down to a year?
13. AES supports a 256-bit key. How many keys does AES-256 have? See if you can
find some number in physics, chemistry, or astronomy of about the same size. Use the
Internet to help search for big numbers. Draw a conclusion from your research.
14. Suppose that a message has been encrypted using DES in counter mode. One bit of
ciphertext in block Ci is accidentally transformed from a 0 to a 1 during transmission.
How much plaintext will be garbled as a result?
15. Now consider ciphertext block chaining again.
Instead of a single 0 bit being
transformed into a 1 bit, an extra 0 bit is inserted into the ciphertext stream after block
Ci. How much plaintext will be garbled as a result?
16. Compare cipher block chaining with cipher feedback mode in terms of the number of
encryption operations needed to transmit a large file. Which one is more efficient and
by how much?
17. Using the RSA public key cryptosystem, with a = 1, b = 2 . . . y = 25, z = 26.

(b) If p = 5, q = 31, and d = 37, find e.
(c) Using p = 3, q = 11, and d = 9, find e and encrypt ‘‘hello’’.
18. Alice and Bob use RSA public key encryption in order to communicate between them.
Trudy finds out that Alice and Bob shared one of the primes used to determine the
number n of their public key pairs. In other words, Trudy found out that na = pa × q
and nb = pb × q. How can Trudy use this information to break Alice’s code?
19. Consider the use of counter mode, as shown in Fig. 8-15, but with IV = 0. Does the
use of 0 threaten the security of the cipher in general?
20. In Fig. 8-20, we see how Alice can send Bob a signed message. If Trudy replaces P,
Bob can detect it. But what happens if Trudy replaces both P and the signature?
21. Digital signatures have a potential weakness due to lazy users.
In e-commerce
transactions, a contract might be drawn up and the user asked to sign its SHA-1 hash.
If the user does not actually verify that the contract and hash correspond, the user may
inadvertently sign a different contract. Suppose that the Mafia try to exploit this
weakness to make some money. They set up a pay Web site (e.g., pornography, gam-
bling, etc.) and ask new customers for a credit card number. Then they send over a
contract saying that the customer wishes to use their service and pay by credit card
and ask the customer to sign it, knowing that most of them will just sign without veri-
fying that the contract and hash agree. Show how the Mafia can buy diamonds from a
legitimate Internet jeweler and charge them to unsuspecting customers.
22. A math class has 25 students. Assuming that all of the students were born in the first
half of the year—between January 1st and June 30th— what is the probability that at
least two students have the same birthday? Assume that nobody was born on leap day,
so there are 181 possible birthdays.
23. After Ellen confessed to Marilyn about tricking her in the matter of Tom’s tenure,
Marilyn resolved to avoid this problem by dictating the contents of future messages
into a dictating machine and having her new secretary just type them in. Marilyn then
planned to examine the messages on her terminal after they had been typed in to make
sure they contained her exact words. Can the new secretary still use the birthday at-
tack to falsify a message, and if so, how? Hint: She can.
24. Consider the failed attempt of Alice to get Bob’s public key in Fig. 8-23. Suppose that
Bob and Alice already share a secret key, but Alice still wants Bob’s public key. Is
there now a way to get it securely? If so, how?
25. Alice wants to communicate with Bob, using public-key cryptography. She estab-
lishes a connection to someone she hopes is Bob. She asks him for his public key and
he sends it to her in plaintext along with an X.509 certificate signed by the root CA.
Alice already has the public key of the root CA. What steps does Alice carry out to
verify that she is talking to Bob? Assume that Bob does not care who he is talking to
(e.g., Bob is some kind of public service).
26. Suppose that a system uses PKI based on a tree-structured hierarchy of CAs. Alice
wants to communicate with Bob, and receives a certificate from Bob signed by a CA
X after establishing a communication channel with Bob. Suppose Alice has never

scribe one type of communication between Jim and Mary which would not require use

compute the secret key.

This seems like overkill. Would one not have done the job?
36. Suppose an organization uses Kerberos for authentication. In terms of security and
service availability, what is the effect if AS or TGS goes down?
37. Alice is using the public-key authentication protocol of Fig. 8-43 to authenticate com-
munication with Bob. However, when sending message 7, Alice forgot to encrypt RB.
Trudy now knows the value of RB. Do Alice and Bob need to repeat the authentica-
tion procedure with new parameters in order to ensure secure communication? Ex-

a malicious merchant can modify his card reader to log all the information on the card

remailer worked correctly, Trudy could not impersonate Alice. After type 1 remailers
were all shut down, Alice switched to a cypherpunk remailer and started a new thread
in her newsgroup. Devise a way for her to prevent Trudy from posting new messages
to the newsgroup, impersonating Alice.
48. Search the Internet for an interesting case involving privacy and write a one-page re-
port on it.
49. Search the Internet for some court case involving copyright versus fair use and write a
1-page report summarizing your findings.
50. Write a program that encrypts its input by XORing it with a keystream. Find or write
as good a random number generator as you can to generate the keystream. The pro-
gram should act as a filter, taking plaintext on standard input and producing ciphertext
on standard output (and vice versa). The program should take one parameter, the key
that seeds the random number generator.
51. Write a procedure that computes the SHA-1 hash of a block of data. The procedure
should have two parameters: a pointer to the input buffer and a pointer to a 20-byte
output buffer. To see the exact specification of SHA-1, search the Internet for FIPS
180-1, which is the full specification.

52. Write a function that accepts a stream of ASCII characters and encrypts this input
using a substitution cipher with the Cipher Block Chaining mode. The block size
should be 8 bytes. The program should take plaintext from the standard input and
print the ciphertext on the standard output. For this problem, you are allowed to select
any reasonable system to determine that the end of the input is reached, and/or when
padding should be applied to complete the block. You may select any output format,
as long as it is unambiguous. The program should receive two parameters:
1. A pointer to the initializing vector; and
2. A number, k, representing the substitution cipher shift, such that each ASCII char-
acter would be encrypted by the kth character ahead of it in the alphabet.
For example, if x = 3, then A is encoded by D, B is encoded by E etc. Make rea-
sonable assumptions with respect to reaching the last character in the ASCII set.
Make sure to document clearly in your code any assumptions you make about the
input and encryption algorithm.
53. The purpose of this problem is to give you a better understanding as to the mechan-
isms of RSA. Write a function that receives as its parameters primes p and q, calcu-
lates public and private RSA keys using these parameters, and outputs n, z, d and e as
printouts to the standard output. The function should also accept a stream of ASCII
characters and encrypt this input using the calculated RSA keys. The program should
take plaintext from the standard input and print the ciphertext to the standard output.
The encryption should be carried out character-wise, that is, take each character in the
input and encrypt it independently of other characters in the input. For this problem,
you are allowed to select any reasonable system to determine that the end of the input
is reached. You may select any output format, as long as it is unambiguous. Make
sure to document clearly in your code any assumptions you make about the input and
encryption algorithm.
