READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
We have now finished our study of computer networks, but this is only the be-
ginning. Many interesting topics have not been treated in as much detail as they
deserve, and others have been omitted altogether for lack of space. In this chap-
ter, we provide some suggestions for further reading and a bibliography, for the
benefit of readers who wish to continue their study of computer networks.
9.1 SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING
There is an extensive literature on all aspects of computer networks. Two
journals that publish papers in this area are IEEE/ACM Transactions on Network-
ing and IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications.
The periodicals of the ACM Special Interest Groups on Data Communications
(SIGCOMM) and Mobility of Systems, Users, Data, and Computing (SIGMO-
BILE) publish many papers of interest, especially on emerging topics. They are
Computer Communication Review and Mobile Computing and Communications
Review.
IEEE also publishes three magazines—IEEE Internet Computing, IEEE Net-
work Magazine, and IEEE Communications Magazine—that contain surveys,
tutorials, and case studies on networking. The first two emphasize architecture,
standards, and software, and the last tends toward communications technology
(fiber optics, satellites, and so on).

READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
CHAP. 9
There are a number of annual or biannual conferences that attract numerous
papers on networks. In particular, look for the SIGCOMM conference, NSDI
(Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation), MobiSys
(Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services), SOSP (Symposium
on Operating Systems Principles) and OSDI (Symposium on Operating Systems
Design and Implementation).
Below we list some suggestions for supplementary reading, keyed to the chap-
ters of this book. Many of the suggestions are books of chapters in books, with
some tutorials and surveys. Full references are in Sec. 9.2.
9.1.1 Introduction and General Works
Comer, The Internet Book, 4th ed.
Anyone looking for an easygoing introduction to the Internet should look
here. Comer describes the history, growth, technology, protocols, and services of
the Internet in terms that novices can understand, but so much material is covered
that the book is also of interest to more technical readers.
Computer Communication Review, 25th Anniversary Issue, Jan. 1995
For a firsthand look at how the Internet developed, this special issue collects
important papers up to 1995. Included are papers that show the development of
TCP, multicast, the DNS, Ethernet, and the overall architecture.
Crovella and Krishnamurthy, Internet Measurement
How do we know how well the Internet works anyway? This question is not
trivial to answer because no one is in charge of the Internet. This book describes
the techniques that have been developed to measure the operation of the Internet,
from network infrastructure to applications.
IEEE Internet Computing, Jan.–Feb. 2000
The first issue of IEEE Internet Computing in the new millennium did exactly
what you would expect: it asked the people who helped create the Internet in the
previous millennium to speculate on where it is going in the next one. The
experts are Paul Baran, Lawrence Roberts, Leonard Kleinrock, Stephen Crocker,
Danny Cohen, Bob Metcalfe, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, and others. See how well their
predictions have fared over a decade later.
Kipnis, ‘‘Beating the System: Abuses of the Standards Adoption Process’’
Standards committees try to be fair and vendor neutral in their work, but un-
fortunately there are companies that try to abuse the system. For example, it has
happened repeatedly that a company helps develop a standard and then after it is
approved, announces that the standard is based on a patent it owns and which it
will license to companies that it likes and not to companies that it does not like, at

prices that it alone determines. For a look at the dark side of standardization, this
article is an excellent start.
Hafner and Lyon, Where Wizards Stay Up Late
Naughton, A Brief History of the Future
Who invented the Internet, anyway? Many people have claimed credit. And
rightly so, since many people had a hand in it, in different ways. There was Paul
Baran, who wrote a report describing packet switching, there were the people at
various universities who designed the ARPANET architecture, there were the
people at BBN who programmed the first IMPs, there were Bob Kahn and Vint
Cerf who invented TCP/IP, and so on. These books tell the story of the Internet,
at least up to 2000, replete with many anecdotes.
9.1.2 The Physical Layer
Bellamy, Digital Telephony, 3rd ed.
For a look back at that other important network, the telephone network, this
authoritative book contains everything you ever wanted to know and more. Par-
ticularly interesting are the chapters on transmission and multiplexing, digital
switching, fiber optics, mobile telephony, and DSL.
Hu and Li, ‘‘Satellite-Based Internet: A Tutorial’’
Internet access via satellite is different from using terrestrial lines. Not only
is there the issue of delay, but routing and switching are also different. In this
paper, the authors examine the issues related to using satellites for Internet access.
Joel, ‘‘Telecommunications and the IEEE Communications Society’’
For a compact but surprisingly comprehensive history of telecommunications,
starting with the telegraph and ending with 802.11, this article is the place to look.
It also covers radio, telephones, analog and digital switching, submarine cables,
digital transmission, television broadcasting, satellites, cable TV, optical commu-
nications, mobile phones, packet switching, the ARPANET, and the Internet.
Palais, Fiber Optic Communication, 5th ed.
Books on fiber optic technology tend to be aimed at the specialist, but this one
is more accessible than most. It covers waveguides, light sources, light detectors,
couplers, modulation, noise, and many other topics.
Su, The UMTS Air Interface in RF Engineering
This book provides a detailed overview of one of the main 3G cellular sys-
tems. It is focused on the air interface, or wireless protocols that are used between
mobiles and the network infrastructure.

READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
CHAP. 9
Want, RFID Explained
Want’s book is an easy-to-read primer on how the unusual technology of the
RFID physical layer works. It covers all aspects of RFID, including its potential
applications. Some real-world examples of RFID deployments and the experience
gained from them is also convered.
9.1.3 The Data Link Layer
Kasim, Delivering Carrier Ethernet
Nowadays, Ethernet is not only a local-area technology. The new fashion is to
use Ethernet as a long-distance link for carrier-grade Ethernet. This book brings
together essays to cover the topic in depth.
Lin and Costello, Error Control Coding, 2nd ed.
Codes to detect and correct errors are central to reliable computer networks.
This popular textbook explains some of the most important codes, from simple
linear Hamming codes to more complex low-density parity check codes. It tries
to do so with the minimum algebra necessary, but that is still a lot.
Stallings, Data and Computer Communications, 9th ed.
Part two covers digital data transmission and a variety of links, including error
detection, error control with retransmissions, and flow control.
9.1.4 The Medium Access Control Sublayer
Andrews et al., Fundamentals of WiMAX
This comprehensive book gives a definitive treatment of WiMAX technology,
from the idea of broadband wireless, to the wireless techniques using OFDM and
multiple antennas, through the multi-access system. Its tutorial style gives about
the most accessible treatment you will find for this heavy material.
Gast, 802.11 Wireless Networks, 2nd ed.
For a readable introduction to the technology and protocols of 802.11, this is a
good place to start. It begins with the MAC sublayer, then introduces material on
the different physical layers and also security. However, the second edition is not
new enough to have much to say about 802.11n.
Perlman, Interconnections, 2nd ed.
For an authoritative but entertaining treatment of bridges, routers, and routing
in general, Perlman’s book is the place to look. The author designed the algo-
rithms used in the IEEE 802 spanning tree bridge and she is one of the world’s
leading authorities on various aspects of networking.

9.1.5 The Network Layer
Comer, Internetworking with TCP/IP, Vol. 1, 5th ed.
Comer has written the definitive work on the TCP/IP protocol suite, now in its
fifth edition. Most of the first half deals with IP and related protocols in the net-
work layer. The other chapters deal primarily with the higher layers and are also
worth reading.
Grayson et al., IP Design for Mobile Networks
Traditional telephone networks and the Internet are on a collision course, with
mobile phone networks being implemented with IP on the inside. This book tells
how to design a network using the IP protocols that supports mobile telephone
service.
Huitema, Routing in the Internet, 2nd ed.
If you want to gain a deep understanding of routing protocols, this is a very
good book. Both pronounceable algorithms (e.g., RIP, and CIDR) and unpro-
nounceable algorithms (e.g., OSPF, IGRP, and BGP) are treated in great detail.
Newer developments are not covered since this is an older book, but what is
covered is explained very well.
Koodli and Perkins, Mobile Inter-networking with IPv6
Two important network layer developments are presented in one volume:
IPv6 and Mobile IP. Both topics are covered well, and Perkins was one of the
driving forces behind Mobile IP.
Nucci and Papagiannaki, Design, Measurement and Management of Large-Scale
IP Networks
We talked a great deal about how networks work, but not how you would de-
sign, deploy and manage one if you were an ISP. This book fills that gap, looking
at modern methods for traffic engineering and how ISPs provide services using
networks.
Perlman, Interconnections, 2nd ed.
In Chaps. 12 through 15, Perlman describes many of the issues involved in
unicast and multicast routing algorithm design, both for wide area networks and
networks of LANs. But by far, the best part of the book is Chap. 18, in which the
author distills her many years of experience with network protocols into an infor-
mative and fun chapter. It is required reading for protocol designers.
Stevens, TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol. 1
Chapters 3–10 provide a comprehensive treatment of IP and related protocols
(ARP, RARP, and ICMP), illustrated by examples.

READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
CHAP. 9
Varghese, Network Algorithmics
We have spent much time talking about how routers and other network ele-
ments interact with each other. This book is different: it is about how routers are
actually designed to forward packets at prodigious speeds. For the inside scoop on
that and related questions, this is the book to read. The author is an authority on
clever algorithms that are used in practice to implement high-speed network ele-
ments in software and hardware.
9.1.6 The Transport Layer
Comer, Internetworking with TCP/IP, Vol. 1, 5th ed.
As mentioned above, Comer has written the definitive work on the TCP/IP
protocol suite. The second half of the book is about UDP and TCP.
Farrell and Cahill, Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking
This short book is the one to read for a deeper look at the architecture, proto-
cols, and applications of ‘‘challenged networks’’ that must operate under harsh
conditions of connectivity. The authors have participated in the development of
DTNs in the IETF DTN Research Group.
Stevens, TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol. 1
Chapters 17–24 provide a comprehensive treatment of TCP illustrated by ex-
amples.
9.1.7 The Application Layer
Berners-Lee et al., ‘‘The World Wide Web’’
Take a trip back in time for a perspective on the Web and where it is going by
the person who invented it and some of his colleagues at CERN. The article
focuses on the Web architecture, URLs, HTTP, and HTML, as well as future di-
rections, and compares it to other distributed information systems.
Held, A Practical Guide to Content Delivery Networks, 2nd ed.
This book gives a down-to-earth exposition of how CDNs work, emphasizing
the practical considerations in designing and operating a CDN that performs well.
Hunter et al., Beginning XML, 4th ed.
There are many, many books on HTML, XML and Web services. This 1000-
page book covers most of what you are likely to want to know. It explains not
only how to write XML and XHTML, but also how to develop Web services that
produce and manipulate XML using Ajax, SOAP, and other techniques that are
commonly used in practice.

SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING
883
Krishnamurthy and Rexford, Web Protocols and Practice
It would be hard to find a more comprehensive book about all aspects of the
Web than this one. It covers clients, servers, proxies, and caching, as you might
expect. But there are also chapters on Web traffic and measurements as well as
chapters on current research and improving the Web.
Simpson, Video Over IP, 2nd ed.
The author takes a broad look at how IP technology can be used to move
video across networks, both on the Internet and in private networks designed to
carry video. Interestingly, this book is oriented for the video professional learning
about networking, rather than the other way around.
Wittenburg, Understanding Voice Over IP Technology
This book covers how voice over IP works, from carrying audio data with the
IP protocols and quality-of-service issues, through to the SIP and H.323 suite of
protocols. It is necessarily detailed given the material, but accessible and broken
up into digestible units.
9.1.8 Network Security
Anderson, Security Engineering, 2nd. ed.
This book presents a wonderful mix of security techniques couched in an un-
derstanding of how people use (and misuse) them. It is more technical than
Secrets and Lies, but less technical than Network Security (see below). After an
introduction to the basic security techniques, entire chapters are devoted to vari-
ous applications, including banking, nuclear command and control, security print-
ing, biometrics, physical security, electronic warfare, telecom security, e-com-
merce, and copyright protection.
Ferguson et al., Cryptography Engineering
Many books tell you how the popular cryptographic algorithms work. This
book tells you how to use cryptography—why cryptographic protocols are de-
signed the way they are and how to put them together into a system that will meet
your security goals. It is a fairly compact book that is essential reading for any-
one designing systems that depend on cryptography.
Fridrich, Steganography in Digital Media
Steganography goes back to ancient Greece, where the wax was melted off
blank tablets so secret messages could be applied to the underlying wood before
the wax was reapplied. Nowadays, videos, audio, and other content on the Inter-
net provide different carriers for secret messages. Various modern techniques for
hiding and finding information in images are discussed here.

CHAP. 9
Kaufman et al., Network Security, 2nd ed.
This authoritative and witty book is the first place to look for more technical
information on network security algorithms and protocols. Secret and public key
algorithms and protocols, message hashes, authentication, Kerberos, PKI, IPsec,
SSL/TLS, and email security are all explained carefully and at considerable
length, with many examples. Chapter 26, on security folklore, is a real gem. In
security, the devil is in the details. Anyone planning to design a security system
that will actually be used will learn a lot from the real-world advice in this chap-
ter.
Schneier, Secrets and Lies
If you read Cryptography Engineering from cover to cover, you will know
everything there is to know about cryptographic algorithms. If you then read
Secrets and Lies cover to cover (which can be done in a lot less time), you will
learn that cryptographic algorithms are not the whole story.
Most security
weaknesses are not due to faulty algorithms or even keys that are too short, but to
flaws in the security environment. For a nontechnical and fascinating discussion
of computer security in the broadest sense, this book is a very good read.
Skoudis and Liston, Counter Hack Reloaded, 2nd ed.
The best way to stop a hacker is to think like a hacker. This book shows how
hackers see a network, and argues that security should be a function of the entire
network’s design, not an afterthought based on one specific technology. It covers
almost all common attacks, including the ‘‘social engineering’’ types that take ad-
vantage of users who are not always familiar with computer security measures.
