CHAPTER1
Computer
Networks and
the Internet
1
Today’s Internet is arguably the largest engineered system ever created by mankind,
with hundreds of millions of connected computers, communication links, and
switches; with billions of users who connect via laptops, tablets, and smartphones;
and with an array of new Internet-connected devices such as sensors, Web cams,
game consoles, picture frames, and even washing machines. Given that the Internet
is so large and has so many diverse components and uses, is there any hope of
understanding how it works? Are there guiding principles and structure that can pro-
vide a foundation for understanding such an amazingly large and complex system?
And if so, is it possible that it actually could be both interesting and fun to learn
about computer networks? Fortunately, the answers to all of these questions is a
resounding YES! Indeed, it’s our aim in this book to provide you with a modern
introduction to the dynamic field of computer networking, giving you the principles
and practical insights you’ll need to understand not only today’s networks, but
tomorrow’s as well.
This first chapter presents a broad overview of computer networking and the
Internet. Our goal here is to paint a broad picture and set the context for the rest of
this book, to see the forest through the trees. We’ll cover a lot of ground in this intro-
ductory chapter and discuss a lot of the pieces of a computer network, without los-
ing sight of the big picture.

We’ll structure our overview of computer networks in this chapter as follows.
After introducing some basic terminology and concepts, we’ll first examine the
basic hardware and software components that make up a network. We’ll begin at
the network’s edge and look at the end systems and network applications running
in the network. We’ll then explore the core of a computer network, examining the
links and the switches that transport data, as well as the access networks and phys-
ical media that connect end systems to the network core. We’ll learn that the Inter-
net is a network of networks, and we’ll learn how these networks connect with
each other.
After having completed this overview of the edge and core of a computer net-
work, we’ll take the broader and more abstract view in the second half of this chap-
ter. We’ll examine delay, loss, and throughput of data in a computer network and
provide simple quantitative models for end-to-end throughput and delay: models
that take into account transmission, propagation, and queuing delays. We’ll then
introduce some of the key architectural principles in computer networking, namely,
protocol layering and service models. We’ll also learn that computer networks are
vulnerable to many different types of attacks; we’ll survey some of these attacks and
consider how computer networks can be made more secure. Finally, we’ll close this
chapter with a brief history of computer networking.
1.1 What Is the Internet?
In this book, we’ll use the public Internet, a specific computer network, as our prin-
cipal vehicle for discussing computer networks and their protocols. But what is the
Internet? There are a couple of ways to answer this question. First, we can describe
the nuts and bolts of the Internet, that is, the basic hardware and software components
that make up the Internet. Second, we can describe the Internet in terms of a net-
working infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications. Let’s begin
with the nuts-and-bolts description, using Figure 1.1 to illustrate our discussion.
1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description
The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of com-
puting devices throughout the world. Not too long ago, these computing devices were
primarily traditional desktop PCs, Linux workstations, and so-called servers that store
and transmit information such as Web pages and e-mail messages. Increasingly,
however, nontraditional Internet end systems such as laptops, smartphones, tablets,
TVs, gaming consoles, Web cams, automobiles, environmental sensing devices,
picture frames, and home electrical and security systems are being connected to the
Internet. Indeed, the term computer network is beginning to sound a bit dated, given
the many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet. In Internet jar-
gon, all of these devices are called hosts or end systems. As of July 2011, there were

nearly 850 million end systems attached to the Internet [ISC 2012], not counting
smartphones, laptops, and other devices that are only intermittently connected to the
Internet. Overall, more there are an estimated 2 billion Internet users [ITU 2011].
End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and
packet switches. We’ll see in Section 1.2 that there are many types of communica-
tion links, which are made up of different types of physical media, including coaxial
cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit
data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second.
When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end sys-
tem segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting pack-
ages of information, known as packets in the jargon of computer networks, are then
sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled
into the original data.
A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet
switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in
today’s Internet are routers and link-layer switches. Both types of switches for-
ward packets toward their ultimate destinations. Link-layer switches are typically
used in access networks, while routers are typically used in the network core. The
sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from
the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path
through the network. The exact amount of traffic being carried in the Internet is
difficult to estimate but Cisco [Cisco VNI 2011] estimates global Internet traffic will
be nearly 40 exabytes per month in 2012.
Packet-switched networks (which transport packets) are in many ways simi-
lar to transportation networks of highways, roads, and intersections (which trans-
port vehicles). Consider, for example, a factory that needs to move a large
amount of cargo to some destination warehouse located thousands of kilometers
away. At the factory, the cargo is segmented and loaded into a fleet of trucks.
Each of the trucks then independently travels through the network of highways,
roads, and intersections to the destination warehouse. At the destination ware-
house, the cargo is unloaded and grouped with the rest of the cargo arriving from
the same shipment. Thus, in many ways, packets are analogous to trucks, com-
munication links are analogous to highways and roads, packet switches are anal-
ogous to intersections, and end systems are analogous to buildings. Just as a truck
takes a path through the transportation network, a packet takes a path through a
computer network.
End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate
ISPs; university ISPs; and ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee
shops, and other public places. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches
and communication links. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the
end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL,
4

high-speed local area network access, wireless access, and 56 kbps dial-up modem
access. ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting Web
sites directly to the Internet. The Internet is all about connecting end systems to
each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be intercon-
nected. These lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and interna-
tional upper-tier ISPs such as Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT.
An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed
fiber-optic links. Each ISP network, whether upper-tier or lower-tier, is managed
independently, runs the IP protocol (see below), and conforms to certain naming
and address conventions. We’ll examine ISPs and their interconnection more
closely in Section 1.3.
End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols
that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of
the most important protocols in the Internet. The IP protocol specifies the format of
the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. The Internet’s
principal protocols are collectively known as TCP/IP. We’ll begin looking into pro-
tocols in this introductory chapter. But that’s just a start—much of this book is con-
cerned with computer network protocols!
Given the importance of protocols to the Internet, it’s important that everyone
agree on what each and every protocol does, so that people can create systems and
products that interoperate. This is where standards come into play. Internet stan-
dards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)[IETF 2012].
The IETF standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs). RFCs
started out as general requests for comments (hence the name) to resolve network
and protocol design problems that faced the precursor to the Internet [Allman 2011].
RFCs tend to be quite technical and detailed. They define protocols such as TCP, IP,
HTTP (for the Web), and SMTP (for e-mail). There are currently more than 6,000
RFCs. Other bodies also specify standards for network components, most notably
for network links. The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee [IEEE 802
2012], for example, specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards.
1.1.2 A Services Description
Our discussion above has identified many of the pieces that make up the Internet.
But we can also describe the Internet from an entirely different angle—namely, as
an infrastructure that provides services to applications. These applications
include electronic mail, Web surfing, social networks, instant messaging, Voice-
over-IP (VoIP), video streaming, distributed games, peer-to-peer (P2P) file shar-
ing, television over the Internet, remote login, and much, much more. The
applications are said to be distributed applications, since they involve multiple
end systems that exchange data with each other. Importantly, Internet applications
1.1

## Page 6

run on end systems—they do not run in the packet switches in the network core.
Although packet switches facilitate the exchange of data among end systems, they
are not concerned with the application that is the source or sink of data.
Let’s explore a little more what we mean by an infrastructure that provides
services to applications. To this end, suppose you have an exciting new idea for a
distributed Internet application, one that may greatly benefit humanity or one that
may simply make you rich and famous. How might you go about transforming
this idea into an actual Internet application? Because applications run on end sys-
tems, you are going to need to write programs that run on the end systems. You
might, for example, write your programs in Java, C, or Python. Now, because you
are developing a distributed Internet application, the programs running on the
different end systems will need to send data to each other. And here we get to a
central issue—one that leads to the alternative way of describing the Internet as a
platform for applications. How does one program running on one end system
instruct the Internet to deliver data to another program running on another end
system?
End systems attached to the Internet provide an Application Programming
Interface (API) that specifies how a program running on one end system asks
the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program run-
ning on another end system. This Internet API is a set of rules that the sending
program must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination
program. We’ll discuss the Internet API in detail in Chapter 2. For now, let’s
draw upon a simple analogy, one that we will frequently use in this book. Sup-
pose Alice wants to send a letter to Bob using the postal service. Alice, of course,
can’t just write the letter (the data) and drop the letter out her window. Instead,
the postal service requires that Alice put the letter in an envelope; write Bob’s
full name, address, and zip code in the center of the envelope; seal the envelope;
put a stamp in the upper-right-hand corner of the envelope; and finally, drop the
envelope into an official postal service mailbox. Thus, the postal service has its
own “postal service API,” or set of rules, that Alice must follow to have the
postal service deliver her letter to Bob. In a similar manner, the Internet has an
API that the program sending data must follow to have the Internet deliver the
data to the program that will receive the data.
The postal service, of course, provides more than one service to its customers.
It provides express delivery, reception confirmation, ordinary use, and many more
services. In a similar manner, the Internet provides multiple services to its applica-
tions. When you develop an Internet application, you too must choose one of the
Internet’s services for your application. We’ll describe the Internet’s services in
Chapter 2.
We have just given two descriptions of the Internet; one in terms of its hardware
and software components, the other in terms of an infrastructure for providing
services to distributed applications. But perhaps you are still confused as to what the

Internet is. What are packet switching and TCP/IP? What are routers? What kinds of
communication links are present in the Internet? What is a distributed application?
How can a toaster or a weather sensor be attached to the Internet? If you feel a bit
overwhelmed by all of this now, don’t worry—the purpose of this book is to intro-
duce you to both the nuts and bolts of the Internet and the principles that govern how
and why it works. We’ll explain these important terms and questions in the follow-
ing sections and chapters.
1.1.3 What Is a Protocol?
Now that we’ve got a bit of a feel for what the Internet is, let’s consider another
important buzzword in computer networking: protocol. What is a protocol? What
does a protocol do?
A Human Analogy
It is probably easiest to understand the notion of a computer network protocol by
first considering some human analogies, since we humans execute protocols all of
the time. Consider what you do when you want to ask someone for the time of day.
A typical exchange is shown in Figure 1.2. Human protocol (or good manners, at
least) dictates that one first offer a greeting (the first “Hi” in Figure 1.2) to initiate
communication with someone else. The typical response to a “Hi” is a returned
“Hi” message. Implicitly, one then takes a cordial “Hi” response as an indication
that one can proceed and ask for the time of day. A different response to the initial
“Hi” (such as “Don’t bother me!” or “I don’t speak English,” or some unprintable
reply) might indicate an unwillingness or inability to communicate. In this case,
the human protocol would be not to ask for the time of day. Sometimes one gets no
response at all to a question, in which case one typically gives up asking that per-
son for the time. Note that in our human protocol, there are specific messages we
send, and specific actions we take in response to the received reply messages or
other events (such as no reply within some given amount of time). Clearly, trans-
mitted and received messages, and actions taken when these messages are sent or
received or other events occur, play a central role in a human protocol. If people
run different protocols (for example, if one person has manners but the other does
not, or if one understands the concept of time and the other does not) the protocols
do not interoperate and no useful work can be accomplished. The same is true in
networking—it takes two (or more) communicating entities running the same pro-
tocol in order to accomplish a task.
Let’s consider a second human analogy. Suppose you’re in a college class (a
computer networking class, for example!). The teacher is droning on about proto-
cols and you’re confused. The teacher stops to ask, “Are there any questions?” (a
1.1

message that is transmitted to, and received by, all students who are not sleeping).
You raise your hand (transmitting an implicit message to the teacher). Your teacher
acknowledges you with a smile, saying “Yes . . .” (a transmitted message encourag-
ing you to ask your question—teachers love to be asked questions), and you then ask
your question (that is, transmit your message to your teacher). Your teacher hears
your question (receives your question message) and answers (transmits a reply to
you). Once again, we see that the transmission and receipt of messages, and a set of
conventional actions taken when these messages are sent and received, are at the
heart of this question-and-answer protocol.
Network Protocols
A network protocol is similar to a human protocol, except that the entities exchang-
ing messages and taking actions are hardware or software components of some
device (for example, computer, smartphone, tablet, router, or other network-capable

device). All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote
entities is governed by a protocol. For example, hardware-implemented protocols in
two physically connected computers control the flow of bits on the “wire” between
the two network interface cards; congestion-control protocols in end systems con-
trol the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver; protocols
in routers determine a packet’s path from source to destination. Protocols are run-
ning everywhere in the Internet, and consequently much of this book is about com-
puter network protocols.
As an example of a computer network protocol with which you are probably
familiar, consider what happens when you make a request to a Web server, that is,
when you type the URL of a Web page into your Web browser. The scenario is illus-
trated in the right half of Figure 1.2. First, your computer will send a connection
request message to the Web server and wait for a reply. The Web server will eventu-
ally receive your connection request message and return a connection reply mes-
sage. Knowing that it is now OK to request the Web document, your computer then
sends the name of the Web page it wants to fetch from that Web server in a GET
message. Finally, the Web server returns the Web page (file) to your computer.
Given the human and networking examples above, the exchange of messages
and the actions taken when these messages are sent and received are the key defin-
ing elements of a protocol:
A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between
two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the trans-
mission and/or receipt of a message or other event.
The Internet, and computer networks in general, make extensive use of proto-
cols. Different protocols are used to accomplish different communication tasks. As
you read through this book, you will learn that some protocols are simple and
straightforward, while others are complex and intellectually deep. Mastering the
field of computer networking is equivalent to understanding the what, why, and how
of networking protocols.
1.2 The Network Edge
In the previous section we presented a high-level overview of the Internet and net-
working protocols. We are now going to delve a bit more deeply into the compo-
nents of a computer network (and the Internet, in particular). We begin in this
section at the edge of a network and look at the components with which we are most
familiar—namely, the computers, smartphones and other devices that we use on a
daily basis. In the next section we’ll move from the network edge to the network
core and examine switching and routing in computer networks.

## Page 10

Recall from the previous section that in computer networking jargon, the com-
puters and other devices connected to the Internet are often referred to as end sys-
tems. They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet,
as shown in Figure 1.3. The Internet’s end systems include desktop computers (e.g.,
desktop PCs, Macs, and Linux boxes), servers (e.g., Web and e-mail servers), and
mobile computers (e.g., laptops, smartphones, and tablets). Furthermore, an increas-
ing number of non-traditional devices are being attached to the Internet as end sys-
tems (see sidebar).
End systems are also referred to as hosts because they host (that is, run) appli-
cation programs such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail
client program, or an e-mail server program. Throughout this book we will use the
terms hosts and end systems interchangeably; that is, host = end system. Hosts are
sometimes further divided into two categories: clients and servers. Informally,
clients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs, smartphones, and so on, whereas servers
tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream
video, relay e-mail, and so on. Today, most of the servers from which we receive

A DIZZYING ARRAY OF INTERNET END SYSTEMS
Not too long ago, the end-system devices connected to the Internet were primarily
traditional computers such as desktop machines and powerful servers. Beginning in
the late 1990s and continuing today, a wide range of interesting devices are being
connected to the Internet, leveraging their ability to send and receive digital data.
Given the Internet’s ubiquity, its well-defined (standardized) protocols, and the
availability of Internet-ready commodity hardware, it’s natural to use Internet tech-
nology to network these devices together and to Internet-connected servers.
Many of these devices are based in the home—video game consoles (e.g.,
Microsoft’s Xbox), Internet-ready televisions, digital picture frames that download
and display digital pictures, washing machines, refrigerators, and even a toaster
that downloads meteorological information and burns an image of the day’s fore-
cast (e.g., mixed clouds and sun) on your morning toast [BBC 2001]. IP-enabled
phones with GPS capabilities put location-dependent services (maps, information
about nearby services or people) at your fingertips. Networked sensors embedded
into the physical environment allow monitoring of buildings, bridges, seismic activi-
ty, wildlife habitats, river estuaries, and the weather. Biomedical devices can be
embedded and networked in a body-area network. With so many diverse devices
being networked together, the Internet is indeed becoming an “Internet of things”
[ITU 2005b].

Having considered the applications and end systems at the “edge of the network,”
let’s next consider the access network—the network that physically connects an end
system to the first router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end
system to any other distant end system. Figure 1.4 shows several types of access

networks with thick, shaded lines, and the settings (home, enterprise, and wide-area
mobile wireless) in which they are used.
Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite
In developed countries today, more than 65 percent of the households have Internet
access, with Korea, Netherlands, Finland, and Sweden leading the way with more than
80 percent of households having Internet access, almost all via a high-speed broadband
connection [ITU 2011]. Finland and Spain have recently declared high-speed Internet
access to be a “legal right.” Given this intense interest in home access, let’s begin our
overview of access networks by considering how homes connect to the Internet.
Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital
subscriber line (DSL) and cable. A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access
from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone
access. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer’s telco is also its ISP. As shown in
Figure 1.5, each customer’s DSL modem uses the existing telephone line (twisted-
pair copper wire, which we’ll discuss in Section 1.2.2) to exchange data with a digi-
tal subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the telco’s local central
office (CO). The home’s DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-
frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to the CO; the analog signals
from many such houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM.
The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone sig-
nals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:
•
A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
•
A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
•
An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band
This approach makes the single DSL link appear as if there were three separate
links, so that a telephone call and an Internet connection can share the DSL link at
the same time. (We’ll describe this technique of frequency-division multiplexing in

Section 1.3.1). On the customer side, a splitter separates the data and telephone sig-
nals arriving to the home and forwards the data signal to the DSL modem. On the
telco side, in the CO, the DSLAM separates the data and phone signals and sends
the data into the Internet. Hundreds or even thousands of households connect to a
single DSLAM [Dischinger 2007].
The DSL standards define transmission rates of 12 Mbps downstream and
1.8 Mbps upstream [ITU 1999], and 24 Mbps downstream and 2.5 Mbps upstream
[ITU 2003]. Because the downstream and upstream rates are different, the access is
said to be asymmetric. The actual downstream and upstream transmission rates
achieved may be less than the rates noted above, as the DSL provider may purpose-
fully limit a residential rate when tiered service (different rates, available at differ-
ent prices) are offered, or because the maximum rate can be limited by the distance
between the home and the CO, the gauge of the twisted-pair line and the degree of
electrical interference. Engineers have expressly designed DSL for short distances
between the home and the CO; generally, if the residence is not located within 5 to 10
miles of the CO, the residence must resort to an alternative form of Internet access.
While DSL makes use of the telco’s existing local telephone infrastructure,
cable Internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable
television infrastructure. A residence obtains cable Internet access from the same
company that provides its cable television. As illustrated in Figure 1.6, fiber optics
connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions, from which tradi-
tional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual houses and apartments. Each
neighborhood junction typically supports 500 to 5,000 homes. Because both fiber
and coaxial cable are employed in this system, it is often referred to as hybrid
fiber coax (HFC).

Cable internet access requires special modems, called cable modems. As with a
DSL modem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to the
home PC through an Ethernet port. (We will discuss Ethernet in great detail in
Chapter 5.) At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS)
serves a similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM—turning the analog signal
sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format.
Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an
upstream channel. As with DSL, access is typically asymmetric, with the down-
stream channel typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream
channel. The DOCSIS 2.0 standard defines downstream rates up to 42.8 Mbps and
upstream rates of up to 30.7 Mbps. As in the case of DSL networks, the maximum
achievable rate may not be realized due to lower contracted data rates or media
impairments.
One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared
broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels down-
stream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the
upstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if several users are simultane-
ously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which
each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable
downstream rate. On the other hand, if there are only a few active users and they
are all Web surfing, then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the
full cable downstream rate, because the users will rarely request a Web page at
exactly the same time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, a distributed
multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions.
(We’ll discuss this collision issue in some detail in Chapter 5.)
Although DSL and cable networks currently represent more than 90 percent of
residential broadband access in the United States, an up-and-coming technology that
promises even higher speeds is the deployment of fiber to the home (FTTH)
[FTTH Council 2011a]. As the name suggests, the FTTH concept is simple—
provide an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home. In the United States,
Verizon has been particularly aggressive with FTTH with its FIOS service [Verizon
FIOS 2012].
There are several competing technologies for optical distribution from the
CO to the homes. The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber,
with one fiber leaving the CO for each home. More commonly, each fiber leav-
ing the central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not until the fiber
gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific
fibers. There are two competing optical-distribution network architectures that
perform this splitting: active optical networks (AONs) and passive optical net-
works (PONs). AON is essentially switched Ethernet, which is discussed in
Chapter 5.
Here, we briefly discuss PON, which is used in Verizon’s FIOS service.
Figure 1.7 shows FTTH using the PON distribution architecture. Each home has

an optical network terminator (ONT), which is connected by dedicated optical
fiber to a neighborhood splitter. The splitter combines a number of homes (typically
less than 100) onto a single, shared optical fiber, which connects to an optical line
terminator (OLT) in the telco’s CO. The OLT, providing conversion between optical
and electrical signals, connects to the Internet via a telco router. In the home, users
connect a home router (typically a wireless router) to the ONT and access the Inter-
net via this home router. In the PON architecture, all packets sent from OLT to the
splitter are replicated at the splitter (similar to a cable head end).
FTTH can potentially provide Internet access rates in the gigabits per second
range. However, most FTTH ISPs provide different rate offerings, with the higher
rates naturally costing more money. The average downstream speed of US FTTH
customers was approximately 20 Mbps in 2011 (compared with 13 Mbps for cable
access networks and less than 5 Mbps for DSL) [FTTH Council 2011b].
Two other access network technologies are also used to provide Internet access
to the home. In locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not available (e.g., in
some rural settings), a satellite link can be used to connect a residence to the Inter-
net at speeds of more than 1 Mbps; StarBand and HughesNet are two such satellite
access providers. Dial-up access over traditional phone lines is based on the same
model as DSL—a home modem connects over a phone line to a modem in the ISP.
Compared with DSL and other broadband access networks, dial-up access is excru-
ciatingly slow at 56 kbps.
Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi
On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings, a local area
network (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge router. Although there
are many types of LAN technologies, Ethernet is by far the most prevalent access
technology in corporate, university, and home networks. As shown in Figure 1.8,
Ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch, a

technology discussed in detail in Chapter 5. The Ethernet switch, or a network of
such interconnected switches, is then in turn connected into the larger Internet. With
Ethernet access, users typically have 100 Mbps access to the Ethernet switch,
whereas servers may have 1 Gbps or even 10 Gbps access.
Increasingly, however, people are accessing the Internet wirelessly from lap-
tops, smartphones, tablets, and other devices (see earlier sidebar on “A Dizzying
Array of Devices”). In a wireless LAN setting, wireless users transmit/receive pack-
ets to/from an access point that is connected into the enterprise’s network (most
likely including wired Ethernet), which in turn is connected to the wired Internet. A
wireless LAN user must typically be within a few tens of meters of the access point.
Wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology, more colloquially known
as WiFi, is now just about everywhere—universities, business offices, cafes, air-
ports, homes, and even in airplanes. In many cities, one can stand on a street corner
and be within range of ten or twenty base stations (for a browseable global map of
802.11 base stations that have been discovered and logged on a Web site by people
who take great enjoyment in doing such things, see [wigle.net 2012]). As discussed
in detail in Chapter 6, 802.11 today provides a shared transmission rate of up to
54 Mbps.
Even though Ethernet and WiFi access networks were initially deployed in enter-
prise (corporate, university) settings, they have recently become relatively common
components of home networks. Many homes combine broadband residential access
(that is, cable modems or DSL) with these inexpensive wireless LAN technologies to
create powerful home networks [Edwards 2011]. Figure 1.9 shows a typical home
network. This home network consists of a roaming laptop as well as a wired PC; a
base station (the wireless access point), which communicates with the wireless PC; a
cable modem, providing broadband access to the Internet; and a router, which inter-
connects the base station and the stationary PC with the cable modem. This network
allows household members to have broadband access to the Internet with one mem-
ber roaming from the kitchen to the backyard to the bedrooms.

Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE
Increasingly, devices such as iPhones, BlackBerrys, and Android devices are being
used to send email, surf the Web, Tweet, and download music while on the run.
These devices employ the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony
to send/receive packets through a base station that is operated by the cellular net-
work provider. Unlike WiFi, a user need only be within a few tens of kilometers (as
opposed to a few tens of meters) of the base station.
Telecommunications companies have made enormous investments in so-called
third-generation (3G) wireless, which provides packet-switched wide-area wireless
Internet access at speeds in excess of 1 Mbps. But even higher-speed wide-area
access technologies—a fourth-generation (4G) of wide-area wireless networks—are
already being deployed. LTE ( for “Long-Term Evolution”—a candidate for Bad
Acronym of the Year Award) has its roots in 3G technology, and can potentially
achieve rates in excess of 10 Mbps. LTE downstream rates of many tens of Mbps
have been reported in commercial deployments. We’ll cover the basic principles of
wireless networks and mobility, as well as WiFi, 3G, and LTE technologies (and
more!) in Chapter 6.
1.2.2 Physical Media
In the previous subsection, we gave an overview of some of the most important
network access technologies in the Internet. As we described these technologies,
we also indicated the physical media used. For example, we said that HFC uses a
combination of fiber cable and coaxial cable. We said that DSL and Ethernet use
copper wire. And we said that mobile access networks use the radio spectrum.

In this subsection we provide a brief overview of these and other transmission
media that are commonly used in the Internet.
In order to define what is meant by a physical medium, let us reflect on the
brief life of a bit. Consider a bit traveling from one end system, through a series of
links and routers, to another end system. This poor bit gets kicked around and
transmitted many, many times! The source end system first transmits the bit, and
shortly thereafter the first router in the series receives the bit; the first router then
transmits the bit, and shortly thereafter the second router receives the bit; and so
on. Thus our bit, when traveling from source to destination, passes through a series
of transmitter-receiver pairs. For each transmitter-receiver pair, the bit is sent by
propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a physical medium.
The physical medium can take many shapes and forms and does not have to be of
the same type for each transmitter-receiver pair along the path. Examples of physi-
cal media include twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable, multimode fiber-optic
cable, terrestrial radio spectrum, and satellite radio spectrum. Physical media fall
into two categories: guided media and unguided media. With guided media, the
waves are guided along a solid medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, a twisted-pair
copper wire, or a coaxial cable. With unguided media, the waves propagate in the
atmosphere and in outer space, such as in a wireless LAN or a digital satellite
channel.
But before we get into the characteristics of the various media types, let us say
a few words about their costs. The actual cost of the physical link (copper wire,
fiber-optic cable, and so on) is often relatively minor compared with other network-
ing costs. In particular, the labor cost associated with the installation of the physical
link can be orders of magnitude higher than the cost of the material. For this reason,
many builders install twisted pair, optical fiber, and coaxial cable in every room in a
building. Even if only one medium is initially used, there is a good chance that
another medium could be used in the near future, and so money is saved by not hav-
ing to lay additional wires in the future.
Twisted-Pair Copper Wire
The least expensive and most commonly used guided transmission medium is
twisted-pair copper wire. For over a hundred years it has been used by telephone
networks. In fact, more than 99 percent of the wired connections from the tele-
phone handset to the local telephone switch use twisted-pair copper wire. Most of
us have seen twisted pair in our homes and work environments. Twisted pair con-
sists of two insulated copper wires, each about 1 mm thick, arranged in a regular
spiral pattern. The wires are twisted together to reduce the electrical interference
from similar pairs close by. Typically, a number of pairs are bundled together in a
cable by wrapping the pairs in a protective shield. A wire pair constitutes a single
communication link. Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is commonly used for
1.2

computer networks within a building, that is, for LANs. Data rates for LANs
using twisted pair today range from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps. The data rates that can
be achieved depend on the thickness of the wire and the distance between trans-
mitter and receiver.
When fiber-optic technology emerged in the 1980s, many people disparaged
twisted pair because of its relatively low bit rates. Some people even felt that fiber-
optic technology would completely replace twisted pair. But twisted pair did not
give up so easily. Modern twisted-pair technology, such as category 6a cable, can
achieve data rates of 10 Gbps for distances up to a hundred meters. In the end,
twisted pair has emerged as the dominant solution for high-speed LAN networking.
As discussed earlier, twisted pair is also commonly used for residential Internet
access. We saw that dial-up modem technology enables access at rates of up to 56
kbps over twisted pair. We also saw that DSL (digital subscriber line) technology
has enabled residential users to access the Internet at tens of Mbps over twisted pair
(when users live close to the ISP’s modem).
Coaxial Cable
Like twisted pair, coaxial cable consists of two copper conductors, but the two con-
ductors are concentric rather than parallel. With this construction and special insula-
tion and shielding, coaxial cable can achieve high data transmission rates. Coaxial
cable is quite common in cable television systems. As we saw earlier, cable televi-
sion systems have recently been coupled with cable modems to provide residential
users with Internet access at rates of tens of Mbps. In cable television and cable
Internet access, the transmitter shifts the digital signal to a specific frequency band,
and the resulting analog signal is sent from the transmitter to one or more receivers.
Coaxial cable can be used as a guided shared medium. Specifically, a number of
end systems can be connected directly to the cable, with each of the end systems
receiving whatever is sent by the other end systems.
Fiber Optics
An optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of light, with each
pulse representing a bit. A single optical fiber can support tremendous bit rates, up
to tens or even hundreds of gigabits per second. They are immune to electromag-
netic interference, have very low signal attenuation up to 100 kilometers, and are
very hard to tap. These characteristics have made fiber optics the preferred long-
haul guided transmission media, particularly for overseas links. Many of the long-
distance telephone networks in the United States and elsewhere now use fiber optics
exclusively. Fiber optics is also prevalent in the backbone of the Internet. However,
the high cost of optical devices—such as transmitters, receivers, and switches—has
hindered their deployment for short-haul transport, such as in a LAN or into the

home in a residential access network. The Optical Carrier (OC) standard link speeds
range from 51.8 Mbps to 39.8 Gbps; these specifications are often referred to as OC-
n, where the link speed equals n × 51.8 Mbps. Standards in use today include OC-1,
OC-3, OC-12, OC-24, OC-48, OC-96, OC-192, OC-768. [Mukherjee 2006,
Ramaswamy 2010] provide coverage of various aspects of optical networking.
Terrestrial Radio Channels
Radio channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum. They are an attractive
medium because they require no physical wire to be installed, can penetrate walls,
provide connectivity to a mobile user, and can potentially carry a signal for long dis-
tances. The characteristics of a radio channel depend significantly on the propagation
environment and the distance over which a signal is to be carried. Environmental con-
siderations determine path loss and shadow fading (which decrease the signal strength
as the signal travels over a distance and around/through obstructing objects), multi-
path fading (due to signal reflection off of interfering objects), and interference (due
to other transmissions and electromagnetic signals).
Terrestrial radio channels can be broadly classified into three groups: those that
operate over very short distance (e.g., with one or two meters); those that operate in
local areas, typically spanning from ten to a few hundred meters; and those that
operate in the wide area, spanning tens of kilometers. Personal devices such as wire-
less headsets, keyboards, and medical devices operate over short distances; the
wireless LAN technologies described in Section 1.2.1 use local-area radio channels;
the cellular access technologies use wide-area radio channels. We’ll discuss radio
channels in detail in Chapter 6.
Satellite Radio Channels
A communication satellite links two or more Earth-based microwave transmitter/
receivers, known as ground stations. The satellite receives transmissions on one fre-
quency band, regenerates the signal using a repeater (discussed below), and transmits
the signal on another frequency. Two types of satellites are used in communications:
geostationary satellites and low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites.
Geostationary satellites permanently remain above the same spot on Earth. This
stationary presence is achieved by placing the satellite in orbit at 36,000 kilometers
above Earth’s surface. This huge distance from ground station through satellite back
to ground station introduces a substantial signal propagation delay of 280 millisec-
onds. Nevertheless, satellite links, which can operate at speeds of hundreds of Mbps,
are often used in areas without access to DSL or cable-based Internet access.
LEO satellites are placed much closer to Earth and do not remain permanently
above one spot on Earth. They rotate around Earth (just as the Moon does) and may
communicate with each other, as well as with ground stations. To provide continuous

coverage to an area, many satellites need to be placed in orbit. There are currently
many low-altitude communication systems in development. Lloyd’s satellite con-
stellations Web page [Wood 2012] provides and collects information on satellite
constellation systems for communications. LEO satellite technology may be used
for Internet access sometime in the future.
1.3 The Network Core
Having examined the Internet’s edge, let us now delve more deeply inside the net-
work core—the mesh of packet switches and links that interconnects the Internet’s
end systems. Figure 1.10 highlights the network core with thick, shaded lines.
1.3.1 Packet Switching
In a network application, end systems exchange messages with each other. Mes-
sages can contain anything the application designer wants. Messages may perform a
control function (for example, the “Hi” messages in our handshaking example in
Figure 1.2) or can contain data, such as an email message, a JPEG image, or an MP3
audio file. To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system,
the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as packets.
Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links
and packet switches (for which there are two predominant types, routers and link-
layer switches). Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate
equal to the full transmission rate of the link. So, if a source end system or a packet
switch is sending a packet of L bits over a link with transmission rate R bits/sec, then
the time to transmit the packet is L/R seconds.
Store-and-Forward Transmission
Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the
links. Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive
the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the
outbound link. To explore store-and-forward transmission in more detail, consider
a simple network consisting of two end systems connected by a single router, as
shown in Figure 1.11. A router will typically have many incident links, since its job
is to switch an incoming packet onto an outgoing link; in this simple example, the
router has the rather simple task of transferring a packet from one (input) link to
the only other attached link. In this example, the source has three packets, each
consisting of L bits, to send to the destination. At the snapshot of time shown in
Figure 1.11, the source has transmitted some of packet 1, and the front of packet 1
has already arrived at the router. Because the router employs store-and-forwarding,
at this instant of time, the router cannot transmit the bits it has received; instead it

must first buffer (i.e., “store”) the packet’s bits. Only after the router has received
all of the packet’s bits can it begin to transmit (i.e., “forward”) the packet onto the
outbound link. To gain some insight into store-and-forward transmission, let’s now
calculate the amount of time that elapses from when the source begins to send the
packet until the destination has received the entire packet. (Here we will ignore
propagation delay—the time it takes for the bits to travel across the wire at near the
speed of light—which will be discussed in Section 1.4.) The source begins to trans-
mit at time 0; at time L/R seconds, the source has transmitted the entire packet, and
the entire packet has been received and stored at the router (since there is no propa-
gation delay). At time L/R seconds, since the router has just received the entire
packet, it can begin to transmit the packet onto the outbound link towards the desti-
nation; at time 2L/R, the router has transmitted the entire packet, and the entire
packet has been received by the destination. Thus, the total delay is 2L/R. If
the switch instead forwarded bits as soon as they arrive (without first receiving the
entire packet), then the total delay would be L/R since bits are not held up at
the router. But, as we will discuss in Section 1.4, routers need to receive, store, and
process the entire packet before forwarding.
Now let’s calculate the amount of time that elapses from when the source
begins to send the first packet until the destination has received all three packets.
As before, at time L/R, the router begins to forward the first packet. But also at time
L/R the source will begin to send the second packet, since it has just finished send-
ing the entire first packet. Thus, at time 2L/R, the destination has received the first
packet and the router has received the second packet. Similarly, at time 3L/R, the
destination has received the first two packets and the router has received the third
packet. Finally, at time 4L/R the destination has received all three packets!
Let’s now consider the general case of sending one packet from source to desti-
nation over a path consisting of N links each of rate R (thus, there are N-1 routers
between source and destination). Applying the same logic as above, we see that the
end-to-end delay is:
(1.1)
You may now want to try to determine what the delay would be for P packets sent
over a series of N links.

## Page 25

Queuing Delays and Packet Loss
Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each attached link, the
packet switch has an output buffer (also called an output queue), which stores
packets that the router is about to send into that link. The output buffers play a key
role in packet switching. If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but
finds the link busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must
wait in the output buffer. Thus, in addition to the store-and-forward delays, packets
suffer output buffer queuing delays. These delays are variable and depend on the
level of congestion in the network. Since the amount of buffer space is finite, an
arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other packets wait-
ing for transmission. In this case, packet loss will occur—either the arriving packet
or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped.
Figure 1.12 illustrates a simple packet-switched network. As in Figure 1.11,
packets are represented by three-dimensional slabs. The width of a slab represents
the number of bits in the packet. In this figure, all packets have the same width and
hence the same length. Suppose Hosts A and B are sending packets to Host E. Hosts
A and B first send their packets along 10 Mbps Ethernet links to the first router. The
router then directs these packets to the 1.5 Mbps link. If, during a short interval of
time, the arrival rate of packets to the router (when converted to bits per second)
exceeds 1.5 Mbps, congestion will occur at the router as packets queue in the link’s
output buffer before being transmitted onto the link. For example, if Host A and B
each send a burst of five packets back-to-back at the same time, then most of these
packets will spend some time waiting in the queue. The situation is, in fact, entirely
analogous to many common-day situations—for example, when we wait in line for
a bank teller or wait in front of a tollbooth. We’ll examine this queuing delay in
more detail in Section 1.4.

Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols
Earlier, we said that a router takes a packet arriving on one of its attached
communication links and forwards that packet onto another one of its attached com-
munication links. But how does the router determine which link it should forward
the packet onto? Packet forwarding is actually done in different ways in different
types of computer networks. Here, we briefly describe how it is done in the
Internet.
In the Internet, every end system has an address called an IP address. When a
source end system wants to send a packet to a destination end system, the source
includes the destination’s IP address in the packet’s header. As with postal addresses,
this address has a hierarchical structure. When a packet arrives at a router in the
network, the router examines a portion of the packet’s destination address and for-
wards the packet to an adjacent router. More specifically, each router has a
forwarding table that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination
addresses) to that router’s outbound links. When a packet arrives at a router, the
router examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this destination
address, to find the appropriate outbound link. The router then directs the packet to
this outbound link.
The end-to-end routing process is analogous to a car driver who does not use
maps but instead prefers to ask for directions. For example, suppose Joe is driving
from Philadelphia to 156 Lakeside Drive in Orlando, Florida. Joe first drives to his
neighborhood gas station and asks how to get to 156 Lakeside Drive in Orlando,
Florida. The gas station attendant extracts the Florida portion of the address and
tells Joe that he needs to get onto the interstate highway I-95 South, which has an
entrance just next to the gas station. He also tells Joe that once he enters Florida,
he should ask someone else there. Joe then takes I-95 South until he gets to Jack-
sonville, Florida, at which point he asks another gas station attendant for directions.
The attendant extracts the Orlando portion of the address and tells Joe that he
should continue on I-95 to Daytona Beach and then ask someone else. In Daytona
Beach, another gas station attendant also extracts the Orlando portion of the
address and tells Joe that he should take I-4 directly to Orlando. Joe takes I-4 and
gets off at the Orlando exit. Joe goes to another gas station attendant, and this time
the attendant extracts the Lakeside Drive portion of the address and tells Joe the
road he must follow to get to Lakeside Drive. Once Joe reaches Lakeside Drive, he
asks a kid on a bicycle how to get to his destination. The kid extracts the 156 por-
tion of the address and points to the house. Joe finally reaches his ultimate destina-
tion. In the above analogy, the gas station attendants and kids on bicycles are
analogous to routers.
We just learned that a router uses a packet’s destination address to index a for-
warding table and determine the appropriate outbound link. But this statement begs
yet another question: How do forwarding tables get set? Are they configured by

---

## Page 27

hand in each and every router, or does the Internet use a more automated procedure?
This issue will be studied in depth in Chapter 4. But to whet your appetite here,
we’ll note now that the Internet has a number of special routing protocols that are
used to automatically set the forwarding tables. A routing protocol may, for exam-
ple, determine the shortest path from each router to each destination and use the
shortest path results to configure the forwarding tables in the routers.
How would you actually like to see the end-to-end route that packets take in the
Internet? We now invite you to get your hands dirty by interacting with the Trace-
route program. Simply visit the site www.traceroute.org, choose a source in a particu-
lar country, and trace the route from that source to your computer. (For a discussion of
Traceroute, see Section 1.4.)
1.3.2 Circuit Switching
There are two fundamental approaches to moving data through a network of links
and switches: circuit switching and packet switching. Having covered packet-
switched networks in the previous subsection, we now turn our attention to circuit-
switched networks.
In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link
transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are
reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems. In
packet-switched networks, these resources are not reserved; a session’s messages
use the resources on demand, and as a consequence, may have to wait (that is,
queue) for access to a communication link. As a simple analogy, consider two
restaurants, one that requires reservations and another that neither requires reserva-
tions nor accepts them. For the restaurant that requires reservations, we have to go
through the hassle of calling before we leave home. But when we arrive at the
restaurant we can, in principle, immediately be seated and order our meal. For the
restaurant that does not require reservations, we don’t need to bother to reserve a
table. But when we arrive at the restaurant, we may have to wait for a table before
we can be seated.
Traditional telephone networks are examples of circuit-switched networks.
Consider what happens when one person wants to send information (voice or fac-
simile) to another over a telephone network. Before the sender can send the infor-
mation, the network must establish a connection between the sender and the
receiver. This is a bona fide connection for which the switches on the path
between the sender and receiver maintain connection state for that connection. In
the jargon of telephony, this connection is called a circuit. When the network
establishes the circuit, it also reserves a constant transmission rate in the net-
work’s links (representing a fraction of each link’s transmission capacity) for the
duration of the connection. Since a given transmission rate has been reserved for
this sender-to-receiver connection, the sender can transfer the data to the receiver
at the guaranteed constant rate.

COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET
Figure 1.13  A simple circuit-switched network consisting of
four switches and four links
Figure 1.13 illustrates a circuit-switched network. In this network, the four cir-
cuit switches are interconnected by four links. Each of these links has four circuits,
so that each link can support four simultaneous connections. The hosts (for exam-
ple, PCs and workstations) are each directly connected to one of the switches. When
two hosts want to communicate, the network establishes a dedicated end-to-end
connection between the two hosts. Thus, in order for Host A to communicate with
Host B, the network must first reserve one circuit on each of two links. In this exam-
ple, the dedicated end-to-end connection uses the second circuit in the first link and
the fourth circuit in the second link. Because each link has four circuits, for each
link used by the end-to-end connection, the connection gets one fourth of the link’s
total transmission capacity for the duration of the connection. Thus, for example, if
each link between adjacent switches has a transmission rate of 1 Mbps, then each
end-to-end circuit-switch connection gets 250 kbps of dedicated transmission rate.
In contrast, consider what happens when one host wants to send a packet to
another host over a packet-switched network, such as the Internet. As with circuit
switching, the packet is transmitted over a series of communication links. But different
from circuit switching, the packet is sent into the network without reserving any link
resources whatsoever. If one of the links is congested because other packets need to be
transmitted over the link at the same time, then the packet will have to wait in a buffer
at the sending side of the transmission link and suffer a delay. The Internet makes its
best effort to deliver packets in a timely manner, but it does not make any guarantees.
Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks
A circuit in a link is implemented with either frequency-division multiplexing
(FDM) or time-division multiplexing (TDM). With FDM, the frequency spec-
trum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link.

---

## Page 29

Specifically, the link dedicates a frequency band to each connection for the
duration of the connection. In telephone networks, this frequency band typically
has a width of 4 kHz (that is, 4,000 hertz or 4,000 cycles per second). The width
of the band is called, not surprisingly, the bandwidth. FM radio stations also use
FDM to share the frequency spectrum between 88 MHz and 108 MHz, with each
station being allocated a specific frequency band.
For a TDM link, time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame
is divided into a fixed number of time slots. When the network establishes a connec-
tion across a link, the network dedicates one time slot in every frame to this connec-
tion. These slots are dedicated for the sole use of that connection, with one time slot
available for use (in every frame) to transmit the connection’s data.
Figure 1.14 illustrates FDM and TDM for a specific network link supporting up
to four circuits. For FDM, the frequency domain is segmented into four bands, each
of bandwidth 4 kHz. For TDM, the time domain is segmented into frames, with four
time slots in each frame; each circuit is assigned the same dedicated slot in the
revolving TDM frames. For TDM, the transmission rate of a circuit is equal to the
frame rate multiplied by the number of bits in a slot. For example, if the link trans-
mits 8,000 frames per second and each slot consists of 8 bits, then the transmission
rate of a circuit is 64 kbps.
Proponents of packet switching have always argued that circuit switching is
wasteful because the dedicated circuits are idle during silent periods. For example,

when one person in a telephone call stops talking, the idle network resources (fre-
quency bands or time slots in the links along the connection’s route) cannot be used
by other ongoing connections. As another example of how these resources can be
underutilized, consider a radiologist who uses a circuit-switched network to
remotely access a series of x-rays. The radiologist sets up a connection, requests an
image, contemplates the image, and then requests a new image. Network resources
are allocated to the connection but are not used (i.e., are wasted) during the radiolo-
gist’s contemplation periods. Proponents of packet switching also enjoy pointing out
that establishing end-to-end circuits and reserving end-to-end transmission capacity
is complicated and requires complex signaling software to coordinate the operation
of the switches along the end-to-end path.
Before we finish our discussion of circuit switching, let’s work through a numeri-
cal example that should shed further insight on the topic. Let us consider how long it
takes to send a file of 640,000 bits from Host A to Host B over a circuit-switched net-
work. Suppose that all links in the network use TDM with 24 slots and have a bit rate
of 1.536 Mbps. Also suppose that it takes 500 msec to establish an end-to-end circuit
before Host A can begin to transmit the file. How long does it take to send the file?
Each circuit has a transmission rate of (1.536 Mbps)/24 = 64 kbps, so it takes (640,000
bits)/(64 kbps) = 10 seconds to transmit the file. To this 10 seconds we add the circuit
establishment time, giving 10.5 seconds to send the file. Note that the transmission
time is independent of the number of links: The transmission time would be 10 sec-
onds if the end-to-end circuit passed through one link or a hundred links. (The actual
end-to-end delay also includes a propagation delay; see Section 1.4.)
Packet Switching Versus Circuit Switching
Having described circuit switching and packet switching, let us compare the two.
Critics of packet switching have often argued that packet switching is not suitable
for real-time services (for example, telephone calls and video conference calls)
because of its variable and unpredictable end-to-end delays (due primarily to vari-
able and unpredictable queuing delays). Proponents of packet switching argue that
(1) it offers better sharing of transmission capacity than circuit switching and (2) it
is simpler, more efficient, and less costly to implement than circuit switching. An
interesting discussion of packet switching versus circuit switching is [Molinero-
Fernandez 2002]. Generally speaking, people who do not like to hassle with restau-
rant reservations prefer packet switching to circuit switching.
Why is packet switching more efficient? Let’s look at a simple example. Sup-
pose users share a 1 Mbps link. Also suppose that each user alternates between peri-
ods of activity, when a user generates data at a constant rate of 100 kbps, and periods
of inactivity, when a user generates no data. Suppose further that a user is active
only 10 percent of the time (and is idly drinking coffee during the remaining 90 per-
cent of the time). With circuit switching, 100 kbps must be reserved for each user at

---

## Page 31

all times. For example, with circuit-switched TDM, if a one-second frame is divided
into 10 time slots of 100 ms each, then each user would be allocated one time slot
per frame.
Thus, the circuit-switched link can support only 10 (= 1 Mbps/100 kbps) simul-
taneous users. With packet switching, the probability that a specific user is active is
0.1 (that is, 10 percent). If there are 35 users, the probability that there are 11 or
more simultaneously active users is approximately 0.0004. (Homework Problem P8
outlines how this probability is obtained.) When there are 10 or fewer simultane-
ously active users (which happens with probability 0.9996), the aggregate arrival
rate of data is less than or equal to 1 Mbps, the output rate of the link. Thus, when
there are 10 or fewer active users, users’ packets flow through the link essentially
without delay, as is the case with circuit switching. When there are more than 10
simultaneously active users, then the aggregate arrival rate of packets exceeds the
output capacity of the link, and the output queue will begin to grow. (It continues to
grow until the aggregate input rate falls back below 1 Mbps, at which point the
queue will begin to diminish in length.) Because the probability of having more than
10 simultaneously active users is minuscule in this example, packet switching pro-
vides essentially the same performance as circuit switching, but does so while
allowing for more than three times the number of users.
Let’s now consider a second simple example. Suppose there are 10 users and that
one user suddenly generates one thousand 1,000-bit packets, while other users
remain quiescent and do not generate packets. Under TDM circuit switching with 10
slots per frame and each slot consisting of 1,000 bits, the active user can only use its
one time slot per frame to transmit data, while the remaining nine time slots in each
frame remain idle. It will be 10 seconds before all of the active user’s one million bits
of data has been transmitted. In the case of packet switching, the active user can con-
tinuously send its packets at the full link rate of 1 Mbps, since there are no other users
generating packets that need to be multiplexed with the active user’s packets. In this
case, all of the active user’s data will be transmitted within 1 second.
The above examples illustrate two ways in which the performance of packet
switching can be superior to that of circuit switching. They also highlight the crucial
difference between the two forms of sharing a link’s transmission rate among multi-
ple data streams. Circuit switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link regard-
less of demand, with allocated but unneeded link time going unused. Packet
switching on the other hand allocates link use on demand. Link transmission capac-
ity will be shared on a packet-by-packet basis only among those users who have
packets that need to be transmitted over the link.
Although packet switching and circuit switching are both prevalent in today’s
telecommunication networks, the trend has certainly been in the direction of packet
switching. Even many of today’s circuit-switched telephone networks are slowly
migrating toward packet switching. In particular, telephone networks often use
packet switching for the expensive overseas portion of a telephone call.

1.3.3 A Network of Networks
We saw earlier that end systems (PCs, smartphones, Web servers, mail servers,
and so on) connect into the Internet via an access ISP. The access ISP can pro-
vide either wired or wireless connectivity, using an array of access technologies
including DSL, cable, FTTH, Wi-Fi, and cellular. Note that the access ISP does
not have to be a telco or a cable company; instead it can be, for example, a uni-
versity (providing Internet access to students, staff, and faculty), or a company
(providing access for its employees). But connecting end users and content
providers into an access ISP is only a small piece of solving the puzzle of con-
necting the billions of end systems that make up the Internet. To complete this
puzzle, the access ISPs themselves must be interconnected. This is done by cre-
ating a network of networks—understanding this phrase is the key to understand-
ing the Internet.
Over the years, the network of networks that forms the Internet has evolved into
a very complex structure. Much of this evolution is driven by economics and
national policy, rather than by performance considerations. In order to understand
today’s Internet network structure, let’s incrementally build a series of network
structures, with each new structure being a better approximation of the complex
Internet that we have today. Recall that the overarching goal is to interconnect the
access ISPs so that all end systems can send packets to each other. One naive
approach would be to have each access ISP directly connect with every other access
ISP. Such a mesh design is, of course, much too costly for the access ISPs, as it
would require each access ISP to have a separate communication link to each of the
hundreds of thousands of other access ISPs all over the world.
Our first network structure, Network Structure 1, interconnects all of the
access ISPs with a single global transit ISP. Our (imaginary) global transit ISP is
a network of routers and communication links that not only spans the globe, but
also has at least one router near each of the hundreds of thousands of access ISPs.
Of course, it would be very costly for the global ISP to build such an extensive
network. To be profitable, it would naturally charge each of the access ISPs for
connectivity, with the pricing reflecting (but not necessarily directly proportional
to) the amount of traffic an access ISP exchanges with the global ISP. Since the
access ISP pays the global transit ISP, the access ISP is said to be a customer and
the global transit ISP is said to be a provider.
Now if some company builds and operates a global transit ISP that is profitable,
then it is natural for other companies to build their own global transit ISPs and com-
pete with the original global transit ISP. This leads to Network Structure 2, which
consists of the hundreds of thousands of access ISPs and multiple global transit
ISPs. The access ISPs certainly prefer Network Structure 2 over Network Structure
1 since they can now choose among the competing global transit providers as a
function of their pricing and services. Note, however, that the global transit ISPs
32
CHAPTER 1

## Page 33

themselves must interconnect: Otherwise access ISPs connected to one of the global
transit providers would not be able to communicate with access ISPs connected to
the other global transit providers.
Network Structure 2, just described, is a two-tier hierarchy with global transit
providers residing at the top tier and access ISPs at the bottom tier. This assumes
that global transit ISPs are not only capable of getting close to each and every access
ISP, but also find it economically desirable to do so. In reality, although some ISPs
do have impressive global coverage and do directly connect with many access ISPs,
no ISP has presence in each and every city in the world. Instead, in any given region,
there may be a regional ISP to which the access ISPs in the region connect. Each
regional ISP then connects to tier-1 ISPs. Tier-1 ISPs are similar to our (imaginary)
global transit ISP; but tier-1 ISPs, which actually do exist, do not have a presence in
every city in the world. There are approximately a dozen tier-1 ISPs, including
Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT. Interestingly, no group officially
sanctions tier-1 status; as the saying goes—if you have to ask if you’re a member of
a group, you’re probably not.
Returning to this network of networks, not only are there multiple competing tier-
1 ISPs, there may be multiple competing regional ISPs in a region. In such a hierar-
chy, each access ISP pays the regional ISP to which it connects, and each regional ISP
pays the tier-1 ISP to which it connects. (An access ISP can also connect directly to a
tier-1 ISP, in which case it pays the tier-1 ISP). Thus, there is customer-provider
relationship at each level of the hierarchy. Note that the tier-1 ISPs do not pay anyone
as they are at the top of the hierarchy. To further complicate matters, in some regions,
there may be a larger regional ISP (possibly spanning an entire country) to which the
smaller regional ISPs in that region connect; the larger regional ISP then connects to a
tier-1 ISP. For example, in China, there are access ISPs in each city, which connect to
provincial ISPs, which in turn connect to national ISPs, which finally connect to tier-1
ISPs [Tian 2012]. We refer to this multi-tier hierarchy, which is still only a crude
approximation of today’s Internet, as Network Structure 3.
To build a network that more closely resembles today’s Internet, we must add
points of presence (PoPs), multi-homing, peering, and Internet exchange points
(IXPs) to the hierarchical Network Structure 3. PoPs exist in all levels of the hier-
archy, except for the bottom (access ISP) level. A PoP is simply a group of one or
more routers (at the same location) in the provider’s network where customer ISPs
can connect into the provider ISP. For a customer network to connect to a
provider’s PoP, it can lease a high-speed link from a third-party telecommunica-
tions provider to directly connect one of its routers to a router at the PoP. Any ISP
(except for tier-1 ISPs) may choose to multi-home, that is, to connect to two or
more provider ISPs. So, for example, an access ISP may multi-home with two
regional ISPs, or it may multi-home with two regional ISPs and also with a tier-1
ISP. Similarly, a regional ISP may multi-home with multiple tier-1 ISPs. When an
1.3
•
THE NETWORK CORE
33

---

## Page 34

ISP multi-homes, it can continue to send and receive packets into the Internet even
if one of its providers has a failure.
As we just learned, customer ISPs pay their provider ISPs to obtain global
Internet interconnectivity. The amount that a customer ISP pays a provider ISP
reflects the amount of traffic it exchanges with the provider. To reduce these costs, a
pair of nearby ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy can peer, that is, they can
directly connect their networks together so that all the traffic between them passes
over the direct connection rather than through upstream intermediaries. When two
ISPs peer, it is typically settlement-free, that is, neither ISP pays the other. As noted
earlier, tier-1 ISPs also peer with one another, settlement-free. For a readable dis-
cussion of peering and customer-provider relationships, see [Van der Berg 2008].
Along these same lines, a third-party company can create an Internet Exchange
Point (IXP) (typically in a stand-alone building with its own switches), which is a
meeting point where multiple ISPs can peer together. There are roughly 300 IXPs in
the Internet today [Augustin 2009]. We refer to this ecosystem—consisting of
access ISPs, regional ISPs, tier-1 ISPs, PoPs, multi-homing, peering, and IXPs—as
Network Structure 4.
We now finally arrive at Network Structure 5, which describes the Internet of
2012. Network Structure 5, illustrated in Figure 1.15, builds on top of Network
Structure 4 by adding content provider networks. Google is currently one of the
leading examples of such a content provider network. As of this writing, it is esti-
mated that Google has 30 to 50 data centers distributed across North America,
Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia. Some of these data centers house
over one hundred thousand servers, while other data centers are smaller, housing
only hundreds of servers. The Google data centers are all interconnected via
Google’s private TCP/IP network, which spans the entire globe but is nevertheless
separate from the public Internet. Importantly, the Google private network only

carries traffic to/from Google servers. As shown in Figure 1.15, the Google
private network attempts to “bypass” the upper tiers of the Internet by peering
(settlement free) with lower-tier ISPs, either by directly connecting with them or
by connecting with them at IXPs [Labovitz 2010]. However, because many access
ISPs can still only be reached by transiting through tier-1 networks, the Google
network also connects to tier-1 ISPs, and pays those ISPs for the traffic it
exchanges with them. By creating its own network, a content provider not only
reduces its payments to upper-tier ISPs, but also has greater control of how its
services are ultimately delivered to end users. Google’s network infrastructure is
described in greater detail in Section 7.2.4.
In summary, today’s Internet—a network of networks—is complex, consisting of
a dozen or so tier-1 ISPs and hundreds of thousands of lower-tier ISPs. The ISPs are
diverse in their coverage, with some spanning multiple continents and oceans, and
others limited to narrow geographic regions. The lower-tier ISPs connect to the
higher-tier ISPs, and the higher-tier ISPs interconnect with one another. Users and
content providers are customers of lower-tier ISPs, and lower-tier ISPs are customers
of higher-tier ISPs. In recent years, major content providers have also created their
own networks and connect directly into lower-tier ISPs where possible.
1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput
in Packet-Switched Networks
Back in Section 1.1 we said that the Internet can be viewed as an infrastructure
that provides services to distributed applications running on end systems. Ideally,
we would like Internet services to be able to move as much data as we want
between any two end systems, instantaneously, without any loss of data. Alas, this
is a lofty goal, one that is unachievable in reality. Instead, computer networks nec-
essarily constrain throughput (the amount of data per second that can be trans-
ferred) between end systems, introduce delays between end systems, and can
actually lose packets. On one hand, it is unfortunate that the physical laws of real-
ity introduce delay and loss as well as constrain throughput. On the other hand,
because computer networks have these problems, there are many fascinating
issues surrounding how to deal with the problems—more than enough issues to
fill a course on computer networking and to motivate thousands of PhD theses! In
this section, we’ll begin to examine and quantify delay, loss, and throughput in
computer networks.
1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Networks
Recall that a packet starts in a host (the source), passes through a series of routers,
and ends its journey in another host (the destination). As a packet travels from one
node (host or router) to the subsequent node (host or router) along this path, the
1.4
•

35

---

## Page 36

packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along the path. The most
important of these delays are the nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmis-
sion delay, and propagation delay; together, these delays accumulate to give a total
nodal delay. The performance of many Internet applications—such as search, Web
browsing, email, maps, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP—are greatly affected
by network delays. In order to acquire a deep understanding of packet switching and
computer networks, we must understand the nature and importance of these delays.
Types of Delay
Let’s explore these delays in the context of Figure 1.16. As part of its end-to-end
route between source and destination, a packet is sent from the upstream node
through router A to router B. Our goal is to characterize the nodal delay at router A.
Note that router A has an outbound link leading to router B. This link is preceded by
a queue (also known as a buffer). When the packet arrives at router A from the
upstream node, router A examines the packet’s header to determine the appropriate
outbound link for the packet and then directs the packet to this link. In this example,
the outbound link for the packet is the one that leads to router B. A packet can be
transmitted on a link only if there is no other packet currently being transmitted on
the link and if there are no other packets preceding it in the queue; if the link is
currently busy or if there are other packets already queued for the link, the newly
arriving packet will then join the queue.
Processing Delay
The time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where to direct the
packet is part of the processing delay. The processing delay can also include other
factors, such as the time needed to check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred
in transmitting the packet’s bits from the upstream node to router A. Processing delays

in high-speed routers are typically on the order of microseconds or less. After this
nodal processing, the router directs the packet to the queue that precedes the link to
router B. (In Chapter 4 we’ll study the details of how a router operates.)
Queuing Delay
At the queue, the packet experiences a queuing delay as it waits to be transmitted onto
the link. The length of the queuing delay of a specific packet will depend on the num-
ber of earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for transmission onto the
link. If the queue is empty and no other packet is currently being transmitted, then our
packet’s queuing delay will be zero. On the other hand, if the traffic is heavy and many
other packets are also waiting to be transmitted, the queuing delay will be long. We
will see shortly that the number of packets that an arriving packet might expect to find
is a function of the intensity and nature of the traffic arriving at the queue. Queuing
delays can be on the order of microseconds to milliseconds in practice.
Transmission Delay
Assuming that packets are transmitted in a first-come-first-served manner, as is com-
mon in packet-switched networks, our packet can be transmitted only after all the
packets that have arrived before it have been transmitted. Denote the length of the
packet by L bits, and denote the transmission rate of the link from router A to router
B by R bits/sec. For example, for a 10 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R = 10 Mbps;
for a 100 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R = 100 Mbps. The transmission delay is
L/R. This is the amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s
bits into the link. Transmission delays are typically on the order of microseconds to
milliseconds in practice.
Propagation Delay
Once a bit is pushed into the link, it needs to propagate to router B. The time
required to propagate from the beginning of the link to router B is the propagation
delay. The bit propagates at the propagation speed of the link. The propagation
speed depends on the physical medium of the link (that is, fiber optics, twisted-pair
copper wire, and so on) and is in the range of
2 108 meters/sec to 3108 meters/sec
which is equal to, or a little less than, the speed of light. The propagation delay is
the distance between two routers divided by the propagation speed. That is, the
propagation delay is d/s, where d is the distance between router A and router B and s
is the propagation speed of the link. Once the last bit of the packet propagates to
node B, it and all the preceding bits of the packet are stored in router B. The whole

---

## Page 38

process then continues with router B now performing the forwarding. In wide-area
networks, propagation delays are on the order of milliseconds.
Comparing Transmission and Propagation Delay
Newcomers to the field of computer networking sometimes have difficulty under-
standing the difference between transmission delay and propagation delay. The differ-
ence is subtle but important. The transmission delay is the amount of time required for
the router to push out the packet; it is a function of the packet’s length and the trans-
mission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with the distance between the two
routers. The propagation delay, on the other hand, is the time it takes a bit to propagate
from one router to the next; it is a function of the distance between the two routers, but
has nothing to do with the packet’s length or the transmission rate of the link.
An analogy might clarify the notions of transmission and propagation delay. Con-
sider a highway that has a tollbooth every 100 kilometers, as shown in Figure 1.17.
You can think of the highway segments between tollbooths as links and the toll-
booths as routers. Suppose that cars travel (that is, propagate) on the highway at a
rate of 100 km/hour (that is, when a car leaves a tollbooth, it instantaneously accel-
erates to 100 km/hour and maintains that speed between tollbooths). Suppose next
that 10 cars, traveling together as a caravan, follow each other in a fixed order. You
can think of each car as a bit and the caravan as a packet. Also suppose that each
tollbooth services (that is, transmits) a car at a rate of one car per 12 seconds, and
that it is late at night so that the caravan’s cars are the only cars on the highway.
Finally, suppose that whenever the first car of the caravan arrives at a tollbooth, it
waits at the entrance until the other nine cars have arrived and lined up behind it.
(Thus the entire caravan must be stored at the tollbooth before it can begin to be for-
warded.) The time required for the tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the
highway is (10 cars)/(5 cars/minute) = 2 minutes. This time is analogous to the
transmission delay in a router. The time required for a car to travel from the exit of
one tollbooth to the next tollbooth is 100 km/(100 km/hour) = 1 hour. This time is
analogous to propagation delay. Therefore, the time from when the caravan is stored
in front of a tollbooth until the caravan is stored in front of the next tollbooth is the
sum of transmission delay and propagation delay—in this example, 62 minutes.

Let’s explore this analogy a bit more. What would happen if the tollbooth service
time for a caravan were greater than the time for a car to travel between tollbooths?
For example, suppose now that the cars travel at the rate of 1,000 km/hour and the toll-
booth services cars at the rate of one car per minute. Then the traveling delay between
two tollbooths is 6 minutes and the time to serve a caravan is 10 minutes. In this case,
the first few cars in the caravan will arrive at the second tollbooth before the last cars
in the caravan leave the first tollbooth. This situation also arises in packet-switched
networks—the first bits in a packet can arrive at a router while many of the remaining
bits in the packet are still waiting to be transmitted by the preceding router.
If a picture speaks a thousand words, then an animation must speak a million
words. The companion Web site for this textbook provides an interactive Java applet
that nicely illustrates and contrasts transmission delay and propagation delay. The
reader is highly encouraged to visit that applet. [Smith 2009] also provides a very
readable discussion of propagation, queueing, and transmission delays.
If we let dproc, dqueue, dtrans, and dprop denote the processing, queuing, transmis-
sion, and propagation delays, then the total nodal delay is given by
dnodal = dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop
The contribution of these delay components can vary significantly. For example,
dprop can be negligible (for example, a couple of microseconds) for a link connect-
ing two routers on the same university campus; however, dprop is hundreds of mil-
liseconds for two routers interconnected by a geostationary satellite link, and can be
the dominant term in dnodal. Similarly, dtrans can range from negligible to significant.
Its contribution is typically negligible for transmission rates of 10 Mbps and higher
(for example, for LANs); however, it can be hundreds of milliseconds for large
Internet packets sent over low-speed dial-up modem links. The processing delay,
dproc, is often negligible; however, it strongly influences a router’s maximum
throughput, which is the maximum rate at which a router can forward packets.
1.4.2 Queuing Delay and Packet Loss
The most complicated and interesting component of nodal delay is the queuing
delay, dqueue. In fact, queuing delay is so important and interesting in computer net-
working that thousands of papers and numerous books have been written about it
[Bertsekas 1991; Daigle 1991; Kleinrock 1975, 1976; Ross 1995]. We give only a
high-level, intuitive discussion of queuing delay here; the more curious reader may
want to browse through some of the books (or even eventually write a PhD thesis
on the subject!). Unlike the other three delays (namely, dproc, dtrans, and dprop), the
queuing delay can vary from packet to packet. For example, if 10 packets arrive
at an empty queue at the same time, the first packet transmitted will suffer no queu-
ing delay, while the last packet transmitted will suffer a relatively large queuing
delay (while it waits for the other nine packets to be transmitted). Therefore, when

characterizing queuing delay, one typically uses statistical measures, such as aver-
age queuing delay, variance of queuing delay, and the probability that the queuing
delay exceeds some specified value.
When is the queuing delay large and when is it insignificant? The answer to this
question depends on the rate at which traffic arrives at the queue, the transmission
rate of the link, and the nature of the arriving traffic, that is, whether the traffic arrives
periodically or arrives in bursts. To gain some insight here, let a denote the average
rate at which packets arrive at the queue (a is in units of packets/sec). Recall that R is
the transmission rate; that is, it is the rate (in bits/sec) at which bits are pushed out of
the queue. Also suppose, for simplicity, that all packets consist of L bits. Then the
average rate at which bits arrive at the queue is La bits/sec. Finally, assume that the
queue is very big, so that it can hold essentially an infinite number of bits. The ratio
La/R, called the traffic intensity, often plays an important role in estimating the
extent of the queuing delay. If La/R > 1, then the average rate at which bits arrive at
the queue exceeds the rate at which the bits can be transmitted from the queue. In this
unfortunate situation, the queue will tend to increase without bound and the queuing
delay will approach infinity! Therefore, one of the golden rules in traffic engineering
is: Design your system so that the traffic intensity is no greater than 1.
Now consider the case La/R ≤1. Here, the nature of the arriving traffic impacts
the queuing delay. For example, if packets arrive periodically—that is, one packet
arrives every L/R seconds—then every packet will arrive at an empty queue and
there will be no queuing delay. On the other hand, if packets arrive in bursts but
periodically, there can be a significant average queuing delay. For example, suppose
N packets arrive simultaneously every (L/R)N seconds. Then the first packet trans-
mitted has no queuing delay; the second packet transmitted has a queuing delay of
L/R seconds; and more generally, the nth packet transmitted has a queuing delay of
(n  1)L/R seconds. We leave it as an exercise for you to calculate the average queu-
ing delay in this example.
The two examples of periodic arrivals described above are a bit academic. Typ-
ically, the arrival process to a queue is random; that is, the arrivals do not follow any
pattern and the packets are spaced apart by random amounts of time. In this more
realistic case, the quantity La/R is not usually sufficient to fully characterize the
queueing delay statistics. Nonetheless, it is useful in gaining an intuitive understand-
ing of the extent of the queuing delay. In particular, if the traffic intensity is close to
zero, then packet arrivals are few and far between and it is unlikely that an arriving
packet will find another packet in the queue. Hence, the average queuing delay will
be close to zero. On the other hand, when the traffic intensity is close to 1, there will
be intervals of time when the arrival rate exceeds the transmission capacity (due to
variations in packet arrival rate), and a queue will form during these periods of time;
when the arrival rate is less than the transmission capacity, the length of the queue
will shrink. Nonetheless, as the traffic intensity approaches 1, the average queue
length gets larger and larger. The qualitative dependence of average queuing delay
on the traffic intensity is shown in Figure 1.18.

One important aspect of Figure 1.18 is the fact that as the traffic intensity
approaches 1, the average queuing delay increases rapidly. A small percentage
increase in the intensity will result in a much larger percentage-wise increase in
delay. Perhaps you have experienced this phenomenon on the highway. If you regu-
larly drive on a road that is typically congested, the fact that the road is typically
congested means that its traffic intensity is close to 1. If some event causes an even
slightly larger-than-usual amount of traffic, the delays you experience can be huge.
To really get a good feel for what queuing delays are about, you are encouraged
once again to visit the companion Web site, which provides an interactive Java
applet for a queue. If you set the packet arrival rate high enough so that the traffic
intensity exceeds 1, you will see the queue slowly build up over time.
Packet Loss
In our discussions above, we have assumed that the queue is capable of holding an
infinite number of packets. In reality a queue preceding a link has finite capacity,
although the queuing capacity greatly depends on the router design and cost.
Because the queue capacity is finite, packet delays do not really approach infinity as
the traffic intensity approaches 1. Instead, a packet can arrive to find a full queue.
With no place to store such a packet, a router will drop that packet; that is, the
packet will be lost. This overflow at a queue can again be seen in the Java applet for
a queue when the traffic intensity is greater than 1.
From an end-system viewpoint, a packet loss will look like a packet having
been transmitted into the network core but never emerging from the network at the
destination. The fraction of lost packets increases as the traffic intensity increases.
Therefore, performance at a node is often measured not only in terms of delay, but
also in terms of the probability of packet loss. As we’ll discuss in the subsequent

chapters, a lost packet may be retransmitted on an end-to-end basis in order to
ensure that all data are eventually transferred from source to destination
1.4.3 End-to-End Delay
Our discussion up to this point has focused on the nodal delay, that is, the delay at a
single router. Let’s now consider the total delay from source to destination. To get a
handle on this concept, suppose there are N  1 routers between the source host and
the destination host. Let’s also suppose for the moment that the network is uncon-
gested (so that queuing delays are negligible), the processing delay at each router
and at the source host is dproc, the transmission rate out of each router and out of the
source host is R bits/sec, and the propagation on each link is dprop. The nodal delays
accumulate and give an end-to-end delay,
dend-end = N (dproc + dtrans + dprop)
(1.2)
where, once again, dtrans = L/R, where L is the packet size. Note that Equation 1.2 is a
generalization of Equation 1.1, which did not take into account processing and propa-
gation delays. We leave it to you to generalize Equation 1.2 to the case of heteroge-
neous delays at the nodes and to the presence of an average queuing delay at each node.
Traceroute
To get a hands-on feel for end-to-end delay in a computer network, we can make use
of the Traceroute program. Traceroute is a simple program that can run in any Inter-
net host. When the user specifies a destination hostname, the program in the source
host sends multiple, special packets toward that destination. As these packets work
their way toward the destination, they pass through a series of routers. When a
router receives one of these special packets, it sends back to the source a short mes-
sage that contains the name and address of the router.
More specifically, suppose there are N  1 routers between the source and the
destination. Then the source will send N special packets into the network, with each
packet addressed to the ultimate destination. These N special packets are marked 1
through N, with the first packet marked 1 and the last packet marked N. When the nth
router receives the nth packet marked n, the router does not forward the packet
toward its destination, but instead sends a message back to the source. When the des-
tination host receives the Nth packet, it too returns a message back to the source. The
source records the time that elapses between when it sends a packet and when it
receives the corresponding return message; it also records the name and address of
the router (or the destination host) that returns the message. In this manner, the source
can reconstruct the route taken by packets flowing from source to destination, and
the source can determine the round-trip delays to all the intervening routers. Trace-
route actually repeats the experiment just described three times, so the source actually
sends 3 • N packets to the destination. RFC 1393 describes Traceroute in detail.

Here is an example of the output of the Traceroute program, where the route
was being traced from the source host gaia.cs.umass.edu (at the University of Mass-
achusetts) to the host cis.poly.edu (at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn). The out-
put has six columns: the first column is the n value described above, that is, the
number of the router along the route; the second column is the name of the router;
the third column is the address of the router (of the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx); the last
three columns are the round-trip delays for three experiments. If the source receives
fewer than three messages from any given router (due to packet loss in the network),
Traceroute places an asterisk just after the router number and reports fewer than
three round-trip times for that router.

In the trace above there are nine routers between the source and the destination.
Most of these routers have a name, and all of them have addresses. For example, the
name of Router 3 is border4-rt-gi-1-3.gw.umass.edu and its address is
128.119.2.194. Looking at the data provided for this same router, we see that
in the first of the three trials the round-trip delay between the source and the router
was 1.03 msec. The round-trip delays for the subsequent two trials were 0.48 and
0.45 msec. These round-trip delays include all of the delays just discussed, includ-
ing transmission delays, propagation delays, router processing delays, and queuing
delays. Because the queuing delay is varying with time, the round-trip delay of
packet n sent to a router n can sometimes be longer than the round-trip delay of
packet n+1 sent to router n+1. Indeed, we observe this phenomenon in the above
example: the delays to Router 6 are larger than the delays to Router 7!
Want to try out Traceroute for yourself? We highly recommended that you visit
http://www.traceroute.org, which provides a Web interface to an extensive list of
sources for route tracing. You choose a source and supply the hostname for any des-
tination. The Traceroute program then does all the work. There are a number of free
software programs that provide a graphical interface to Traceroute; one of our
favorites is PingPlotter [PingPlotter 2012].
End System, Application, and Other Delays
In addition to processing, transmission, and propagation delays, there can be addi-
tional significant delays in the end systems. For example, an end system wanting to

---

## Page 44

transmit a packet into a shared medium (e.g., as in a WiFi or cable modem scenario)
may purposefully delay its transmission as part of its protocol for sharing the
medium with other end systems; we’ll consider such protocols in detail in Chapter
5. Another important delay is media packetization delay, which is present in Voice-
over-IP (VoIP) applications. In VoIP, the sending side must first fill a packet with
encoded digitized speech before passing the packet to the Internet. This time to fill a
packet—called the packetization delay—can be significant and can impact the user-
perceived quality of a VoIP call. This issue will be further explored in a homework
problem at the end of this chapter.
1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks
In addition to delay and packet loss, another critical performance measure in com-
puter networks is end-to-end throughput. To define throughput, consider transfer-
ring a large file from Host A to Host B across a computer network. This transfer
might be, for example, a large video clip from one peer to another in a P2P file
sharing system. The instantaneous throughput at any instant of time is the rate
(in bits/sec) at which Host B is receiving the file. (Many applications, including
many P2P file sharing systems, display the instantaneous throughput during
downloads in the user interface—perhaps you have observed this before!) If the
file consists of F bits and the transfer takes T seconds for Host B to receive all F
bits, then the average throughput of the file transfer is F/T bits/sec. For some
applications, such as Internet telephony, it is desirable to have a low delay and an
instantaneous throughput consistently above some threshold (for example, over
24 kbps for some Internet telephony applications and over 256 kbps for some real-
time video applications). For other applications, including those involving file
transfers, delay is not critical, but it is desirable to have the highest possible
throughput.
To gain further insight into the important concept of throughput, let’s consider a
few examples. Figure 1.19(a) shows two end systems, a server and a client, con-
nected by two communication links and a router. Consider the throughput for a file
transfer from the server to the client. Let Rs denote the rate of the link between
the server and the router; and Rc denote the rate of the link between the router and
the client. Suppose that the only bits being sent in the entire network are those
from the server to the client. We now ask, in this ideal scenario, what is the server-
to-client throughput? To answer this question, we may think of bits as fluid and
communication links as pipes. Clearly, the server cannot pump bits through its link
at a rate faster than Rs bps; and the router cannot forward bits at a rate faster than Rc
bps. If Rs < Rc, then the bits pumped by the server will “flow” right through the
router and arrive at the client at a rate of Rs bps, giving a throughput of Rs bps. If, on
the other hand, Rc < Rs, then the router will not be able to forward bits as quickly as
it receives them. In this case, bits will only leave the router at rate Rc, giving an
44
CHAPTER 1
•

•
DELAY, LOSS, AND THROUGHPUT IN PACKET-SWITCHED NETWORKS
45
end-to-end throughput of Rc. (Note also that if bits continue to arrive at the router at
rate Rs, and continue to leave the router at Rc, the backlog of bits at the router wait-
ing for transmission to the client will grow and grow—a most undesirable situation!)
Thus, for this simple two-link network, the throughput is min{Rc, Rs}, that is, it is
the transmission rate of the bottleneck link. Having determined the throughput, we
can now approximate the time it takes to transfer a large file of F bits from server to
client as F/min{Rs, Rc}. For a specific example, suppose you are downloading an
MP3 file of F = 32 million bits, the server has a transmission rate of Rs = 2 Mbps,
and you have an access link of Rc = 1 Mbps. The time needed to transfer the file is
then 32 seconds. Of course, these expressions for throughput and transfer time are
only approximations, as they do not account for store-and-forward and processing
delays as well as protocol issues.
Figure 1.19(b) now shows a network with N links between the server and the
client, with the transmission rates of the N links being R1, R2,..., RN. Applying the
same analysis as for the two-link network, we find that the throughput for a file
transfer from server to client is min{R1, R2,..., RN}, which is once again the trans-
mission rate of the bottleneck link along the path between server and client.
Now consider another example motivated by today’s Internet. Figure 1.20(a)
shows two end systems, a server and a client, connected to a computer network.
Consider the throughput for a file transfer from the server to the client. The server is
connected to the network with an access link of rate Rs and the client is connected to
the network with an access link of rate Rc. Now suppose that all the links in the core
of the communication network have very high transmission rates, much higher than
Rs and Rc. Indeed, today, the core of the Internet is over-provisioned with high speed
links that experience little congestion. Also suppose that the only bits being sent in
the entire network are those from the server to the client. Because the core of the
computer network is like a wide pipe in this example, the rate at which bits can flow

## Page 46

from source to destination is again the minimum of Rs and Rc, that is, throughput =
min{Rs, Rc}. Therefore, the constraining factor for throughput in today’s Internet is
typically the access network.
For a final example, consider Figure 1.20(b) in which there are 10 servers and
10 clients connected to the core of the computer network. In this example, there are
10 simultaneous downloads taking place, involving 10 client-server pairs. Suppose
that these 10 downloads are the only traffic in the network at the current time. As
shown in the figure, there is a link in the core that is traversed by all 10 downloads.
Denote R for the transmission rate of this link R. Let’s suppose that all server access
links have the same rate Rs, all client access links have the same rate Rc, and the
transmission rates of all the links in the core—except the one common link of rate
R—are much larger than Rs, Rc, and R. Now we ask, what are the throughputs of the
downloads? Clearly, if the rate of the common link, R, is large—say a hundred times
larger than both Rs and Rc—then the throughput for each download will once again
be min{Rs, Rc}. But what if the rate of the common link is of the same order as Rs
and Rc? What will the throughput be in this case? Let’s take a look at a specific

## Page 47

example. Suppose Rs = 2 Mbps, Rc = 1 Mbps, R = 5 Mbps, and the common link
divides its transmission rate equally among the 10 downloads. Then the bottleneck
for each download is no longer in the access network, but is now instead the shared
link in the core, which only provides each download with 500 kbps of throughput.
Thus the end-to-end throughput for each download is now reduced to 500 kbps.
The examples in Figure 1.19 and Figure 1.20(a) show that throughput depends
on the transmission rates of the links over which the data flows. We saw that when
there is no other intervening traffic, the throughput can simply be approximated as
the minimum transmission rate along the path between source and destination. The
example in Figure 1.20(b) shows that more generally the throughput depends not
only on the transmission rates of the links along the path, but also on the intervening
traffic. In particular, a link with a high transmission rate may nonetheless be the bot-
tleneck link for a file transfer if many other data flows are also passing through that
link. We will examine throughput in computer networks more closely in the home-
work problems and in the subsequent chapters.
1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models
From our discussion thus far, it is apparent that the Internet is an extremely compli-
cated system. We have seen that there are many pieces to the Internet: numerous
applications and protocols, various types of end systems, packet switches, and vari-
ous types of link-level media. Given this enormous complexity, is there any hope of
organizing a network architecture, or at least our discussion of network architecture?
Fortunately, the answer to both questions is yes.
1.5.1 Layered Architecture
Before attempting to organize our thoughts on Internet architecture, let’s look for a
human analogy. Actually, we deal with complex systems all the time in our every-
day life. Imagine if someone asked you to describe, for example, the airline system.
How would you find the structure to describe this complex system that has ticketing
agents, baggage checkers, gate personnel, pilots, airplanes, air traffic control, and a
worldwide system for routing airplanes? One way to describe this system might be
to describe the series of actions you take (or others take for you) when you fly on an
airline. You purchase your ticket, check your bags, go to the gate, and eventually get
loaded onto the plane. The plane takes off and is routed to its destination. After your
plane lands, you deplane at the gate and claim your bags. If the trip was bad, you
complain about the flight to the ticket agent (getting nothing for your effort). This
scenario is shown in Figure 1.21.
Already, we can see some analogies here with computer networking: You are
being shipped from source to destination by the airline; a packet is shipped from
1.5

## Page 48

source host to destination host in the Internet. But this is not quite the analogy we
are after. We are looking for some structure in Figure 1.21. Looking at Figure 1.21,
we note that there is a ticketing function at each end; there is also a baggage func-
tion for already-ticketed passengers, and a gate function for already-ticketed and
already-baggage-checked passengers. For passengers who have made it through the
gate (that is, passengers who are already ticketed, baggage-checked, and through the
gate), there is a takeoff and landing function, and while in flight, there is an airplane-
routing function. This suggests that we can look at the functionality in Figure 1.21
in a horizontal manner, as shown in Figure 1.22.
Figure 1.22 has divided the airline functionality into layers, providing a frame-
work in which we can discuss airline travel. Note that each layer, combined with the

layers below it, implements some functionality, some service. At the ticketing layer
and below, airline-counter-to-airline-counter transfer of a person is accomplished.
At the baggage layer and below, baggage-check-to-baggage-claim transfer of a per-
son and bags is accomplished. Note that the baggage layer provides this service only
to an already-ticketed person. At the gate layer, departure-gate-to-arrival-gate trans-
fer of a person and bags is accomplished. At the takeoff/landing layer, runway-to-
runway transfer of people and their bags is accomplished. Each layer provides its
service by (1) performing certain actions within that layer (for example, at the gate
layer, loading and unloading people from an airplane) and by (2) using the services
of the layer directly below it (for example, in the gate layer, using the runway-to-
runway passenger transfer service of the takeoff/landing layer).
A layered architecture allows us to discuss a well-defined, specific part of a
large and complex system. This simplification itself is of considerable value by pro-
viding modularity, making it much easier to change the implementation of the serv-
ice provided by the layer. As long as the layer provides the same service to the layer
above it, and uses the same services from the layer below it, the remainder of the
system remains unchanged when a layer’s implementation is changed. (Note that
changing the implementation of a service is very different from changing the serv-
ice itself!) For example, if the gate functions were changed (for instance, to have
people board and disembark by height), the remainder of the airline system would
remain unchanged since the gate layer still provides the same function (loading and
unloading people); it simply implements that function in a different manner after the
change. For large and complex systems that are constantly being updated, the ability
to change the implementation of a service without affecting other components of the
system is another important advantage of layering.
Protocol Layering
But enough about airlines. Let’s now turn our attention to network protocols. To
provide structure to the design of network protocols, network designers organize
protocols—and the network hardware and software that implement the protocols—
in layers. Each protocol belongs to one of the layers, just as each function in the
airline architecture in Figure 1.22 belonged to a layer. We are again interested in
the services that a layer offers to the layer above—the so-called service model of
a layer. Just as in the case of our airline example, each layer provides its service
by (1) performing certain actions within that layer and by (2) using the services of
the layer directly below it. For example, the services provided by layer n may
include reliable delivery of messages from one edge of the network to the other.
This might be implemented by using an unreliable edge-to-edge message delivery
service of layer n  1, and adding layer n functionality to detect and retransmit
lost messages.
A protocol layer can be implemented in software, in hardware, or in a combina-
tion of the two. Application-layer protocols—such as HTTP and SMTP—are almost

---

## Page 50

always implemented in software in the end systems; so are transport-layer protocols.
Because the physical layer and data link layers are responsible for handling commu-
nication over a specific link, they are typically implemented in a network interface
card (for example, Ethernet or WiFi interface cards) associated with a given link.
The network layer is often a mixed implementation of hardware and software. Also
note that just as the functions in the layered airline architecture were distributed
among the various airports and flight control centers that make up the system, so too
is a layer n protocol distributed among the end systems, packet switches, and other
components that make up the network. That is, there’s often a piece of a layer n pro-
tocol in each of these network components.
Protocol layering has conceptual and structural advantages [RFC 3439]. As we
have seen, layering provides a structured way to discuss system components. Mod-
ularity makes it easier to update system components. We mention, however, that
some researchers and networking engineers are vehemently opposed to layering
[Wakeman 1992]. One potential drawback of layering is that one layer may dupli-
cate lower-layer functionality. For example, many protocol stacks provide error
recovery on both a per-link basis and an end-to-end basis. A second potential draw-
back is that functionality at one layer may need information (for example, a time-
stamp value) that is present only in another layer; this violates the goal of
separation of layers.
When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called the protocol
stack. The Internet protocol stack consists of five layers: the physical, link, network,
transport, and application layers, as shown in Figure 1.23(a). If you examine the
Table of Contents, you will see that we have roughly organized this book using the
layers of the Internet protocol stack. We take a top-down approach, first covering
the application layer and then proceeding downward.

PROTOCOL LAYERS AND THEIR SERVICE MODELS

Application Layer
The application layer is where network applications and their application-layer proto-
cols reside. The Internet’s application layer includes many protocols, such as the HTTP
protocol (which provides for Web document request and transfer), SMTP (which pro-
vides for the transfer of e-mail messages), and FTP (which provides for the transfer of
files between two end systems). We’ll see that certain network functions, such as the
translation of human-friendly names for Internet end systems like www.ietf.org to a
32-bit network address, are also done with the help of a specific application-layer pro-
tocol, namely, the domain name system (DNS). We’ll see in Chapter 2 that it is very
easy to create and deploy our own new application-layer protocols.
An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems, with the
application in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of information
with the application in another end system. We’ll refer to this packet of information
at the application layer as a message.
Transport Layer
The Internet’s transport layer transports application-layer messages between
application endpoints. In the Internet there are two transport protocols, TCP and
UDP, either of which can transport application-layer messages. TCP provides a
connection-oriented service to its applications. This service includes guaranteed
delivery of application-layer messages to the destination and flow control (that is,
sender/receiver speed matching). TCP also breaks long messages into shorter seg-
ments and provides a congestion-control mechanism, so that a source throttles its
transmission rate when the network is congested. The UDP protocol provides a con-
nectionless service to its applications. This is a no-frills service that provides no
reliability, no flow control, and no congestion control. In this book, we’ll refer to a
transport-layer packet as a segment.
Network Layer
The Internet’s network layer is responsible for moving network-layer packets
known as datagrams from one host to another. The Internet transport-layer proto-
col (TCP or UDP) in a source host passes a transport-layer segment and a destina-
tion address to the network layer, just as you would give the postal service a letter
with a destination address. The network layer then provides the service of deliver-
ing the segment to the transport layer in the destination host.
The Internet’s network layer includes the celebrated IP Protocol, which defines
the fields in the datagram as well as how the end systems and routers act on these
fields. There is only one IP protocol, and all Internet components that have a net-
work layer must run the IP protocol. The Internet’s network layer also contains rout-
ing protocols that determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and

---

## Page 52

destinations. The Internet has many routing protocols. As we saw in Section 1.3, the
Internet is a network of networks, and within a network, the network administrator
can run any routing protocol desired. Although the network layer contains both the
IP protocol and numerous routing protocols, it is often simply referred to as the IP
layer, reflecting the fact that IP is the glue that binds the Internet together.
Link Layer
The Internet’s network layer routes a datagram through a series of routers between
the source and destination. To move a packet from one node (host or router) to the
next node in the route, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer. In
particular, at each node, the network layer passes the datagram down to the link
layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route. At this next
node, the link layer passes the datagram up to the network layer.
The services provided by the link layer depend on the specific link-layer proto-
col that is employed over the link. For example, some link-layer protocols provide
reliable delivery, from transmitting node, over one link, to receiving node. Note that
this reliable delivery service is different from the reliable delivery service of TCP,
which provides reliable delivery from one end system to another. Examples of link-
layer protocols include Ethernet, WiFi, and the cable access network’s DOCSIS pro-
tocol. As datagrams typically need to traverse several links to travel from source to
destination, a datagram may be handled by different link-layer protocols at different
links along its route. For example, a datagram may be handled by Ethernet on one
link and by PPP on the next link. The network layer will receive a different service
from each of the different link-layer protocols. In this book, we’ll refer to the link-
layer packets as frames.
Physical Layer
While the job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one network element
to an adjacent network element, the job of the physical layer is to move the individ-
ual bits within the frame from one node to the next. The protocols in this layer are
again link dependent and further depend on the actual transmission medium of the
link (for example, twisted-pair copper wire, single-mode fiber optics). For example,
Ethernet has many physical-layer protocols: one for twisted-pair copper wire,
another for coaxial cable, another for fiber, and so on. In each case, a bit is moved
across the link in a different way.
The OSI Model
Having discussed the Internet protocol stack in detail, we should mention that it is
not the only protocol stack around. In particular, back in the late 1970s, the Interna-
tional Organization for Standardization (ISO) proposed that computer networks be
52

organized around seven layers, called the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
model [ISO 2012]. The OSI model took shape when the protocols that were to
become the Internet protocols were in their infancy, and were but one of many dif-
ferent protocol suites under development; in fact, the inventors of the original OSI
model probably did not have the Internet in mind when creating it. Nevertheless,
beginning in the late 1970s, many training and university courses picked up on the
ISO mandate and organized courses around the seven-layer model. Because of its
early impact on networking education, the seven-layer model continues to linger on
in some networking textbooks and training courses.
The seven layers of the OSI reference model, shown in Figure 1.23(b), are:
application layer, presentation layer, session layer, transport layer, network layer,
data link layer, and physical layer. The functionality of five of these layers is
roughly the same as their similarly named Internet counterparts. Thus, let’s consider
the two additional layers present in the OSI reference model—the presentation layer
and the session layer. The role of the presentation layer is to provide services that
allow communicating applications to interpret the meaning of data exchanged.
These services include data compression and data encryption (which are self-
explanatory) as well as data description (which, as we will see in Chapter 9, frees
the applications from having to worry about the internal format in which data are
represented/stored—formats that may differ from one computer to another). The
session layer provides for delimiting and synchronization of data exchange, includ-
ing the means to build a checkpointing and recovery scheme.
The fact that the Internet lacks two layers found in the OSI reference model
poses a couple of interesting questions: Are the services provided by these layers
unimportant? What if an application needs one of these services? The Internet’s
answer to both of these questions is the same—it’s up to the application developer.
It’s up to the application developer to decide if a service is important, and if the
service is important, it’s up to the application developer to build that functionality
into the application.
1.5.2 Encapsulation
Figure 1.24 shows the physical path that data takes down a sending end system’s
protocol stack, up and down the protocol stacks of an intervening link-layer switch
and router, and then up the protocol stack at the receiving end system. As we discuss
later in this book, routers and link-layer switches are both packet switches. Similar
to end systems, routers and link-layer switches organize their networking hardware
and software into layers. But routers and link-layer switches do not implement all of
the layers in the protocol stack; they typically implement only the bottom layers. As
shown in Figure 1.24, link-layer switches implement layers 1 and 2; routers imple-
ment layers 1 through 3. This means, for example, that Internet routers are capable
of implementing the IP protocol (a layer 3 protocol), while link-layer switches are
not. We’ll see later that while link-layer switches do not recognize IP addresses, they
1.5

are capable of recognizing layer 2 addresses, such as Ethernet addresses. Note that
hosts implement all five layers; this is consistent with the view that the Internet
architecture puts much of its complexity at the edges of the network.
Figure 1.24 also illustrates the important concept of encapsulation. At the
sending host, an application-layer message (M in Figure 1.24) is passed to the
transport layer. In the simplest case, the transport layer takes the message and
appends additional information (so-called transport-layer header information, Ht
in Figure 1.24) that will be used by the receiver-side transport layer. The applica-
tion-layer message and the transport-layer header information together constitute
the transport-layer segment. The transport-layer segment thus encapsulates the
application-layer message. The added information might include information
allowing the receiver-side transport layer to deliver the message up to the appro-
priate application, and error-detection bits that allow the receiver to determine
whether bits in the message have been changed in route. The transport layer then
passes the segment to the network layer, which adds network-layer header infor-
mation (Hn in Figure 1.24) such as source and destination end system addresses,

creating a network-layer datagram. The datagram is then passed to the link
layer, which (of course!) will add its own link-layer header information and create
a link-layer frame. Thus, we see that at each layer, a packet has two types of
fields: header fields and a payload field. The payload is typically a packet from
the layer above.
A useful analogy here is the sending of an interoffice memo from one corpo-
rate branch office to another via the public postal service. Suppose Alice, who is
in one branch office, wants to send a memo to Bob, who is in another branch
office. The memo is analogous to the application-layer message. Alice puts the
memo in an interoffice envelope with Bob’s name and department written on the
front of the envelope. The interoffice envelope is analogous to a transport-layer
segment—it contains header information (Bob’s name and department number)
and it encapsulates the application-layer message (the memo). When the sending
branch-office mailroom receives the interoffice envelope, it puts the interoffice
envelope inside yet another envelope, which is suitable for sending through the
public postal service. The sending mailroom also writes the postal address of the
sending and receiving branch offices on the postal envelope. Here, the postal
envelope is analogous to the datagram—it encapsulates the transport-layer seg-
ment (the interoffice envelope), which encapsulates the original message (the
memo). The postal service delivers the postal envelope to the receiving branch-
office mailroom. There, the process of de-encapsulation is begun. The mailroom
extracts the interoffice memo and forwards it to Bob. Finally, Bob opens the enve-
lope and removes the memo.
The process of encapsulation can be more complex than that described above.
For example, a large message may be divided into multiple transport-layer segments
(which might themselves each be divided into multiple network-layer datagrams).
At the receiving end, such a segment must then be reconstructed from its constituent
datagrams.
1.6 Networks Under Attack
The Internet has become mission critical for many institutions today, including large
and small companies, universities, and government agencies. Many individuals also
rely on the Internet for many of their professional, social, and personal activities.
But behind all this utility and excitement, there is a dark side, a side where “bad
guys” attempt to wreak havoc in our daily lives by damaging our Internet-connected
computers, violating our privacy, and rendering inoperable the Internet services on
which we depend.
The field of network security is about how the bad guys can attack computer
networks and about how we, soon-to-be experts in computer networking, can

CHAPTER 1

COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET
defend networks against those attacks, or better yet, design new architectures that
are immune to such attacks in the first place. Given the frequency and variety of
existing attacks as well as the threat of new and more destructive future attacks,
network security has become a central topic in the field of computer networking.
One of the features of this textbook is that it brings network security issues to the
forefront.
Since we don’t yet have expertise in computer networking and Internet proto-
cols, we’ll begin here by surveying some of today’s more prevalent security-
related problems. This will whet our appetite for more substantial discussions in
the upcoming chapters. So we begin here by simply asking, what can go wrong?
How are computer networks vulnerable? What are some of the more prevalent
types of attacks today?
The bad guys can put malware into your host via the Internet
We attach devices to the Internet because we want to receive/send data from/to
the Internet. This includes all kinds of good stuff, including Web pages, e-mail
messages, MP3s, telephone calls, live video, search engine results, and so on.
But, unfortunately, along with all that good stuff comes malicious stuff—collec-
tively known as malware—that can also enter and infect our devices. Once mal-
ware infects our device it can do all kinds of devious things, including deleting
our files; installing spyware that collects our private information, such as social
security numbers, passwords, and keystrokes, and then sends this (over the Inter-
net, of course!) back to the bad guys. Our compromised host may also be
enrolled in a network of thousands of similarly compromised devices, collec-
tively known as a botnet, which the bad guys control and leverage for spam e-
mail distribution or distributed denial-of-service attacks (soon to be discussed)
against targeted hosts.
Much of the malware out there today is self-replicating: once it infects one
host, from that host it seeks entry into other hosts over the Internet, and from the
newly infected hosts, it seeks entry into yet more hosts. In this manner, self-
replicating malware can spread exponentially fast. Malware can spread in the
form of a virus or a worm. Viruses are malware that require some form of user
interaction to infect the user’s device. The classic example is an e-mail attachment
containing malicious executable code. If a user receives and opens such an attach-
ment, the user inadvertently runs the malware on the device. Typically, such e-
mail viruses are self-replicating: once executed, the virus may send an identical
message with an identical malicious attachment to, for example, every recipient in
the user’s address book. Worms are malware that can enter a device without any
explicit user interaction. For example, a user may be running a vulnerable network
application to which an attacker can send malware. In some cases, without any
user intervention, the application may accept the malware from the Internet and

---

## Page 57

run it, creating a worm. The worm in the newly infected device then scans the
Internet, searching for other hosts running the same vulnerable network applica-
tion. When it finds other vulnerable hosts, it sends a copy of itself to those hosts.
Today, malware, is pervasive and costly to defend against. As you work through
this textbook, we encourage you to think about the following question: What can
computer network designers do to defend Internet-attached devices from malware
attacks?
The bad guys can attack servers and network infrastructure
Another broad class of security threats are known as denial-of-service (DoS)
attacks. As the name suggests, a DoS attack renders a network, host, or other piece
of infrastructure unusable by legitimate users. Web servers, e-mail servers, DNS
servers (discussed in Chapter 2), and institutional networks can all be subject to DoS
attacks. Internet DoS attacks are extremely common, with thousands of DoS attacks
occurring every year [Moore 2001; Mirkovic 2005]. Most Internet DoS attacks fall
into one of three categories:
•
Vulnerability attack. This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to a vul-
nerable application or operating system running on a targeted host. If the right
sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or operating system, the
service can stop or, worse, the host can crash.
•
Bandwidth flooding. The attacker sends a deluge of packets to the targeted
host—so many packets that the target’s access link becomes clogged, preventing
legitimate packets from reaching the server.
•
Connection flooding. The attacker establishes a large number of half-open or
fully open TCP connections (TCP connections are discussed in Chapter 3) at the
target host. The host can become so bogged down with these bogus connections
that it stops accepting legitimate connections.
Let’s now explore the bandwidth-flooding attack in more detail. Recalling our
delay and loss analysis discussion in Section 1.4.2, it’s evident that if the server has an
access rate of R bps, then the attacker will need to send traffic at a rate of approxi-
mately R bps to cause damage. If R is very large, a single attack source may not be
able to generate enough traffic to harm the server. Furthermore, if all the traffic
emanates from a single source, an upstream router may be able to detect the attack and
block all traffic from that source before the traffic gets near the server. In a distributed
DoS (DDoS) attack, illustrated in Figure 1.25, the attacker controls multiple sources
and has each source blast traffic at the target. With this approach, the aggregate traffic
rate across all the controlled sources needs to be approximately R to cripple the
1.6

service. DDoS attacks leveraging botnets with thousands of comprised hosts are a
common occurrence today [Mirkovic 2005]. DDos attacks are much harder to detect
and defend against than a DoS attack from a single host.
We encourage you to consider the following question as you work your way
through this book: What can computer network designers do to defend against DoS
attacks? We will see that different defenses are needed for the three types of DoS
attacks.
The bad guys can sniff packets
Many users today access the Internet via wireless devices, such as WiFi-connected
laptops or handheld devices with cellular Internet connections (covered in Chapter
6). While ubiquitous Internet access is extremely convenient and enables marvelous
new applications for mobile users, it also creates a major security vulnerability—by
placing a passive receiver in the vicinity of the wireless transmitter, that receiver can
obtain a copy of every packet that is transmitted! These packets can contain all kinds
of sensitive information, including passwords, social security numbers, trade
secrets, and private personal messages. A passive receiver that records a copy of
every packet that flies by is called a packet sniffer.
Sniffers can be deployed in wired environments as well. In wired broadcast envi-
ronments, as in many Ethernet LANs, a packet sniffer can obtain copies of broadcast
packets sent over the LAN. As described in Section 1.2, cable access technologies
also broadcast packets and are thus vulnerable to sniffing. Furthermore, a bad guy
who gains access to an institution’s access router or access link to the Internet may

be able to plant a sniffer that makes a copy of every packet going to/from the organi-
zation. Sniffed packets can then be analyzed offline for sensitive information.
Packet-sniffing software is freely available at various Web sites and as commercial
products. Professors teaching a networking course have been known to assign lab exer-
cises that involve writing a packet-sniffing and application-layer data reconstruction
program. Indeed, the Wireshark [Wireshark 2012] labs associated with this text (see the
introductory Wireshark lab at the end of this chapter) use exactly such a packet sniffer!
Because packet sniffers are passive—that is, they do not inject packets into the
channel—they are difficult to detect. So, when we send packets into a wireless chan-
nel, we must accept the possibility that some bad guy may be recording copies of
our packets. As you may have guessed, some of the best defenses against packet
sniffing involve cryptography. We will examine cryptography as it applies to net-
work security in Chapter 8.
The bad guys can masquerade as someone you trust
It is surprisingly easy (you will have the knowledge to do so shortly as you proceed
through this text!) to create a packet with an arbitrary source address, packet con-
tent, and destination address and then transmit this hand-crafted packet into the
Internet, which will dutifully forward the packet to its destination. Imagine the
unsuspecting receiver (say an Internet router) who receives such a packet, takes the
(false) source address as being truthful, and then performs some command embed-
ded in the packet’s contents (say modifies its forwarding table). The ability to inject
packets into the Internet with a false source address is known as IP spoofing, and is
but one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as another user.
To solve this problem, we will need end-point authentication, that is, a mecha-
nism that will allow us to determine with certainty if a message originates from
where we think it does. Once again, we encourage you to think about how this can
be done for network applications and protocols as you progress through the chapters
of this book. We will explore mechanisms for end-point authentication in Chapter 8.
In closing this section, it’s worth considering how the Internet got to be such an
insecure place in the first place. The answer, in essence, is that the Internet was orig-
inally designed to be that way, based on the model of “a group of mutually trusting
users attached to a transparent network” [Blumenthal 2001]—a model in which (by
definition) there is no need for security. Many aspects of the original Internet archi-
tecture deeply reflect this notion of mutual trust. For example, the ability for one
user to send a packet to any other user is the default rather than a requested/granted
capability, and user identity is taken at declared face value, rather than being authen-
ticated by default.
But today’s Internet certainly does not involve “mutually trusting users.”
Nonetheless, today’s users still need to communicate when they don’t necessarily
trust each other, may wish to communicate anonymously, may communicate indi-
rectly through third parties (e.g., Web caches, which we’ll study in Chapter 2, or

mobility-assisting agents, which we’ll study in Chapter 6), and may distrust the
hardware, software, and even the air through which they communicate. We now
have many security-related challenges before us as we progress through this book:
We should seek defenses against sniffing, end-point masquerading, man-in-the-
middle attacks, DDoS attacks, malware, and more. We should keep in mind that
communication among mutually trusted users is the exception rather than the rule.
Welcome to the world of modern computer networking!
1.7 History of Computer Networking and
the Internet
Sections 1.1 through 1.6 presented an overview of the technology of computer net-
working and the Internet. You should know enough now to impress your family and
friends! However, if you really want to be a big hit at the next cocktail party, you
should sprinkle your discourse with tidbits about the fascinating history of the Inter-
net [Segaller 1998].
1.7.1 The Development of Packet Switching: 1961–1972
The field of computer networking and today’s Internet trace their beginnings
back to the early 1960s, when the telephone network was the world’s dominant
communication network. Recall from Section 1.3 that the telephone network uses
circuit switching to transmit information from a sender to a receiver—an appro-
priate choice given that voice is transmitted at a constant rate between sender
and receiver. Given the increasing importance of computers in the early 1960s
and the advent of timeshared computers, it was perhaps natural to consider how
to hook computers together so that they could be shared among geographically
distributed users. The traffic generated by such users was likely to be bursty—
intervals of activity, such as the sending of a command to a remote computer, fol-
lowed by periods of inactivity while waiting for a reply or while contemplating
the received response.
Three research groups around the world, each unaware of the others’ work
[Leiner 1998], began inventing packet switching as an efficient and robust alterna-
tive to circuit switching. The first published work on packet-switching techniques
was that of Leonard Kleinrock [Kleinrock 1961; Kleinrock 1964], then a graduate
student at MIT. Using queuing theory, Kleinrock’s work elegantly demonstrated the
effectiveness of the packet-switching approach for bursty traffic sources. In 1964,
Paul Baran [Baran 1964] at the Rand Institute had begun investigating the use of
packet switching for secure voice over military networks, and at the National Physi-
cal Laboratory in England, Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury were also devel-
oping their ideas on packet switching.

## Page 61

The work at MIT, Rand, and the NPL laid the foundations for today’s Inter-
net. But the Internet also has a long history of a let’s-build-it-and-demonstrate-it
attitude that also dates back to the 1960s. J. C. R. Licklider [DEC 1990] and
Lawrence Roberts, both colleagues of Kleinrock’s at MIT, went on to lead the
computer science program at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in
the United States. Roberts published an overall plan for the ARPAnet [Roberts
1967], the first packet-switched computer network and a direct ancestor of today’s
public Internet. On Labor Day in 1969, the first packet switch was installed at
UCLA under Kleinrock’s supervision, and three additional packet switches were
installed shortly thereafter at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), UC Santa Bar-
bara, and the University of Utah (Figure 1.26). The fledgling precursor to the

COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET
Internet was four nodes large by the end of 1969. Kleinrock recalls the very first
use of the network to perform a remote login from UCLA to SRI, crashing the sys-
tem [Kleinrock 2004].
By 1972, ARPAnet had grown to approximately 15 nodes and was given its first
public demonstration by Robert Kahn. The first host-to-host protocol between
ARPAnet end systems, known as the network-control protocol (NCP), was com-
pleted [RFC 001]. With an end-to-end protocol available, applications could now be
written. Ray Tomlinson wrote the first e-mail program in 1972.
1.7.2 Proprietary Networks and Internetworking: 1972–1980
The initial ARPAnet was a single, closed network. In order to communicate with an
ARPAnet host, one had to be actually attached to another ARPAnet IMP. In the early
to mid-1970s, additional stand-alone packet-switching networks besides ARPAnet
came into being: ALOHANet, a microwave network linking universities on the
Hawaiian islands [Abramson 1970], as well as DARPA’s packet-satellite [RFC 829]
and packet-radio networks [Kahn 1978]; Telenet, a BBN commercial packet-
switching network based on ARPAnet technology; Cyclades, a French packet-
switching network pioneered by Louis Pouzin [Think 2012]; Time-sharing networks
such as Tymnet and the GE Information Services network, among others, in the late
1960s and early 1970s [Schwartz 1977]; IBM’s SNA (1969–1974), which paral-
leled the ARPAnet work [Schwartz 1977].
The number of networks was growing. With perfect hindsight we can see that
the time was ripe for developing an encompassing architecture for connecting net-
works together. Pioneering work on interconnecting networks (under the sponsor-
ship of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)), in essence
creating a network of networks, was done by Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn [Cerf
1974]; the term internetting was coined to describe this work.
These architectural principles were embodied in TCP. The early versions of
TCP, however, were quite different from today’s TCP. The early versions of TCP
combined a reliable in-sequence delivery of data via end-system retransmission
(still part of today’s TCP) with forwarding functions (which today are performed
by IP). Early experimentation with TCP, combined with the recognition of the
importance of an unreliable, non-flow-controlled, end-to-end transport service
for applications such as packetized voice, led to the separation of IP out of TCP
and the development of the UDP protocol. The three key Internet protocols that
we see today—TCP, UDP, and IP—were conceptually in place by the end of the
1970s.
In addition to the DARPA Internet-related research, many other important
networking activities were underway. In Hawaii, Norman Abramson was devel-
oping ALOHAnet, a packet-based radio network that allowed multiple remote
sites on the Hawaiian Islands to communicate with each other. The ALOHA protocol

---

## Page 63

[Abramson 1970] was the first multiple-access protocol, allowing geographically
distributed users to share a single broadcast communication medium (a radio fre-
quency). Metcalfe and Boggs built on Abramson’s multiple-access protocol work
when they developed the Ethernet protocol [Metcalfe 1976] for wire-based
shared broadcast networks. Interestingly, Metcalfe and Boggs’ Ethernet protocol
was motivated by the need to connect multiple PCs, printers, and shared disks
[Perkins 1994]. Twenty-five years ago, well before the PC revolution and the
explosion of networks, Metcalfe and Boggs were laying the foundation for
today’s PC LANs.
1.7.3 A Proliferation of Networks: 1980–1990
By the end of the 1970s, approximately two hundred hosts were connected to the
ARPAnet. By the end of the 1980s the number of hosts connected to the public
Internet, a confederation of networks looking much like today’s Internet, would
reach a hundred thousand. The 1980s would be a time of tremendous growth.
Much of that growth resulted from several distinct efforts to create computer
networks linking universities together. BITNET provided e-mail and file transfers
among several universities in the Northeast. CSNET (computer science network)
was formed to link university researchers who did not have access to ARPAnet. In
1986, NSFNET was created to provide access to NSF-sponsored supercomputing
centers. Starting with an initial backbone speed of 56 kbps, NSFNET’s backbone
would be running at 1.5 Mbps by the end of the decade and would serve as a pri-
mary backbone linking regional networks.
In the ARPAnet community, many of the final pieces of today’s Internet archi-
tecture were falling into place. January 1, 1983 saw the official deployment of
TCP/IP as the new standard host protocol for ARPAnet (replacing the NCP proto-
col). The transition [RFC 801] from NCP to TCP/IP was a flag day event—all
hosts were required to transfer over to TCP/IP as of that day. In the late 1980s,
important extensions were made to TCP to implement host-based congestion con-
trol [Jacobson 1988]. The DNS, used to map between a human-readable Internet
name (for example, gaia.cs.umass.edu) and its 32-bit IP address, was also devel-
oped [RFC 1034].
Paralleling this development of the ARPAnet (which was for the most part a
US effort), in the early 1980s the French launched the Minitel project, an ambi-
tious plan to bring data networking into everyone’s home. Sponsored by the
French government, the Minitel system consisted of a public packet-switched net-
work (based on the X.25 protocol suite), Minitel servers, and inexpensive termi-
nals with built-in low-speed modems. The Minitel became a huge success in 1984
when the French government gave away a free Minitel terminal to each French
household that wanted one. Minitel sites included free sites—such as a telephone
directory site—as well as private sites, which collected a usage-based fee from

each user. At its peak in the mid 1990s, it offered more than 20,000 services, rang-
ing from home banking to specialized research databases. The Minitel was in a
large proportion of French homes 10 years before most Americans had ever heard
of the Internet.
1.7.4 The Internet Explosion: The 1990s
The 1990s were ushered in with a number of events that symbolized the continued
evolution and the soon-to-arrive commercialization of the Internet. ARPAnet, the
progenitor of the Internet, ceased to exist. In 1991, NSFNET lifted its restrictions on
the use of NSFNET for commercial purposes. NSFNET itself would be decommis-
sioned in 1995, with Internet backbone traffic being carried by commercial Internet
Service Providers.
The main event of the 1990s was to be the emergence of the World Wide Web
application, which brought the Internet into the homes and businesses of millions of
people worldwide. The Web served as a platform for enabling and deploying hun-
dreds of new applications that we take for granted today, including search (e.g.,
Google and Bing) Internet commerce (e.g., Amazon and eBay) and social networks
(e.g., Facebook).
The Web was invented at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee between 1989 and 1991
[Berners-Lee 1989], based on ideas originating in earlier work on hypertext from
the 1940s by Vannevar Bush [Bush 1945] and since the 1960s by Ted Nelson
[Xanadu 2012]. Berners-Lee and his associates developed initial versions of HTML,
HTTP, a Web server, and a browser—the four key components of the Web. Around
the end of 1993 there were about two hundred Web servers in operation, this collec-
tion of servers being just a harbinger of what was about to come. At about this time
several researchers were developing Web browsers with GUI interfaces, including
Marc Andreessen, who along with Jim Clark, formed Mosaic Communications,
which later became Netscape Communications Corporation [Cusumano 1998; Quittner
1998]. By 1995, university students were using Netscape browsers to surf the Web
on a daily basis. At about this time companies—big and small—began to operate
Web servers and transact commerce over the Web. In 1996, Microsoft started to
make browsers, which started the browser war between Netscape and Microsoft,
which Microsoft won a few years later [Cusumano 1998].
The second half of the 1990s was a period of tremendous growth and innova-
tion for the Internet, with major corporations and thousands of startups creating
Internet products and services. By the end of the millennium the Internet was sup-
porting hundreds of popular applications, including four killer applications:
•
E-mail, including attachments and Web-accessible e-mail
•
The Web, including Web browsing and Internet commerce

Interestingly, the first two killer applications came from the research community,
whereas the last two were created by a few young entrepreneurs.
The period from 1995 to 2001 was a roller-coaster ride for the Internet in the
financial markets. Before they were even profitable, hundreds of Internet startups
made initial public offerings and started to be traded in a stock market. Many com-
panies were valued in the billions of dollars without having any significant revenue
streams. The Internet stocks collapsed in 2000–2001, and many startups shut down.
Nevertheless, a number of companies emerged as big winners in the Internet space,
including Microsoft, Cisco, Yahoo, e-Bay, Google, and Amazon.
1.7.5 The New Millennium
Innovation in computer networking continues at a rapid pace. Advances are being
made on all fronts, including deployments of faster routers and higher transmission
speeds in both access networks and in network backbones. But the following devel-
opments merit special attention:
•
Since the beginning of the millennium, we have been seeing aggressive deploy-
ment of broadband Internet access to homes—not only cable modems and DSL
but also fiber to the home, as discussed in Section 1.2. This high-speed Internet
access has set the stage for a wealth of video applications, including the distribu-
tion of user-generated video (for example, YouTube), on-demand streaming of
movies and television shows (e.g., Netflix) , and multi-person video conference
(e.g., Skype).
•
The increasing ubiquity of high-speed (54 Mbps and higher) public WiFi net-
works and medium-speed (up to a few Mbps) Internet access via 3G and 4G
cellular telephony networks is not only making it possible to remain con-
stantly connected while on the move, but also enabling new location-specific
applications. The number of wireless devices connecting to the Internet sur-
passed the number of wired devices in 2011. This high-speed wireless access
has set the stage for the rapid emergence of hand-held computers (iPhones,
Androids, iPads, and so on), which enjoy constant and untethered access to
the Internet.
•
Online social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, have created massive peo-
ple networks on top of the Internet. Many Internet users today “live” primarily
within Facebook. Through their APIs, the online social networks create plat-
forms for new networked applications and distributed games.

COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET
•
As discussed in Section 1.3.3, online service providers, such as Google and
Microsoft, have deployed their own extensive private networks, which not only
connect together their globally distributed data centers, but are used to bypass
the Internet as much as possible by peering directly with lower-tier ISPs. As a
result, Google provides search results and email access almost instantaneously,
as if their data centers were running within one’s own computer.
•
Many Internet commerce companies are now running their applications in the
“cloud”—such as in Amazon’s EC2, in Google’s Application Engine, or in
Microsoft’s Azure. Many companies and universities have also migrated their Inter-
net applications (e.g., email and Web hosting) to the cloud. Cloud companies not
only provide applications scalable computing and storage environments, but also
provide the applications implicit access to their high-performance private networks.
1.8 Summary
In this chapter we’ve covered a tremendous amount of material! We’ve looked at the
various pieces of hardware and software that make up the Internet in particular and
computer networks in general. We started at the edge of the network, looking at end
systems and applications, and at the transport service provided to the applications
running on the end systems. We also looked at the link-layer technologies and phys-
ical media typically found in the access network. We then dove deeper inside the
network, into the network core, identifying packet switching and circuit switching
as the two basic approaches for transporting data through a telecommunication net-
work, and we examined the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also
examined the structure of the global Internet, learning that the Internet is a network
of networks. We saw that the Internet’s hierarchical structure, consisting of higher-
and lower-tier ISPs, has allowed it to scale to include thousands of networks.
In the second part of this introductory chapter, we examined several topics central
to the field of computer networking. We first examined the causes of delay, through-
put and packet loss in a packet-switched network. We developed simple quantitative
models for transmission, propagation, and queuing delays as well as for throughput;
we’ll make extensive use of these delay models in the homework problems through-
out this book. Next we examined protocol layering and service models, key architec-
tural principles in networking that we will also refer back to throughout this book. We
also surveyed some of the more prevalent security attacks in the Internet day. We fin-
ished our introduction to networking with a brief history of computer networking. The
first chapter in itself constitutes a mini-course in computer networking.
So, we have indeed covered a tremendous amount of ground in this first chapter!
If you’re a bit overwhelmed, don’t worry. In the following chapters we’ll revisit all of
these ideas, covering them in much more detail (that’s a promise, not a threat!). At this
point, we hope you leave this chapter with a still-developing intuition for the pieces

that make up a network, a still-developing command of the vocabulary of networking
(don’t be shy about referring back to this chapter), and an ever-growing desire to learn
more about networking. That’s the task ahead of us for the rest of this book.
Road-Mapping This Book
Before starting any trip, you should always glance at a road map in order to become
familiar with the major roads and junctures that lie ahead. For the trip we are about
to embark on, the ultimate destination is a deep understanding of the how, what, and
why of computer networks. Our road map is the sequence of chapters of this book:
1. Computer Networks and the Internet
2. Application Layer
3. Transport Layer
4. Network Layer
5. Link Layer and Local Area Networks
6. Wireless and Mobile Networks
7. Multimedia Networking
8. Security in Computer Networks
9. Network Management
Chapters 2 through 5 are the four core chapters of this book. You should notice
that these chapters are organized around the top four layers of the five-layer Internet
protocol stack, one chapter for each layer. Further note that our journey will begin at
the top of the Internet protocol stack, namely, the application layer, and will work
its way downward. The rationale behind this top-down journey is that once we
understand the applications, we can understand the network services needed to sup-
port these applications. We can then, in turn, examine the various ways in which
such services might be implemented by a network architecture. Covering applica-
tions early thus provides motivation for the remainder of the text.
The second half of the book—Chapters 6 through 9—zooms in on four enor-
mously important (and somewhat independent) topics in modern computer network-
ing. In Chapter 6, we examine wireless and mobile networks, including wireless
LANs (including WiFi and Bluetooth), Cellular telephony networks (including
GSM, 3G, and 4G), and mobility (in both IP and GSM networks). In Chapter 7
(Multimedia Networking) we examine audio and video applications such as Internet
phone, video conferencing, and streaming of stored media. We also look at how a
packet-switched network can be designed to provide consistent quality of service to
audio and video applications. In Chapter 8 (Security in Computer Networks), we
first look at the underpinnings of encryption and network security, and then we
examine how the basic theory is being applied in a broad range of Internet contexts.
The last chapter (Network Management) examines the key issues in network man-
agement as well as the primary Internet protocols used for network management.

Problems
P1. Design and describe an application-level protocol to be used between an
automatic teller machine and a bank’s centralized computer. Your protocol
should allow a user’s card and password to be verified, the account balance
(which is maintained at the centralized computer) to be queried, and an
account withdrawal to be made (that is, money disbursed to the user). Your

protocol entities should be able to handle the all-too-common case in which
there is not enough money in the account to cover the withdrawal. Specify
your protocol by listing the messages exchanged and the action taken by the
automatic teller machine or the bank’s centralized computer on transmission
and receipt of messages. Sketch the operation of your protocol for the case of a
simple withdrawal with no errors, using a diagram similar to that in Figure 1.2.
Explicitly state the assumptions made by your protocol about the underlying
end-to-end transport service.
P2. Equation 1.1 gives a formula for the end-to-end delay of sending one packet
of length L over N links of transmission rate R. Generalize this formula for
sending P such packets back-to-back over the N links.
P3. Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the
sender generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small and
fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running for a
relatively long period of time. Answer the following questions, briefly justi-
fying your answer:
a. Would a packet-switched network or a circuit-switched network be more
appropriate for this application? Why?
b. Suppose that a packet-switched network is used and the only traffic in
this network comes from such applications as described above. Further-
more, assume that the sum of the application data rates is less than the
capacities of each and every link. Is some form of congestion control
needed? Why?
P4. Consider the circuit-switched network in Figure 1.13. Recall that there are 4
circuits on each link. Label the four switches A, B, C and D, going in the
clockwise direction.
a. What is the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be in
progress at any one time in this network?
b. Suppose that all connections are between switches A and C. What is the
maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be in progress?
c. Suppose we want to make four connections between switches A and C,
and another four connections between switches B and D. Can we route
these calls through the four links to accommodate all eight connections?
P5. Review the car-caravan analogy in Section 1.4. Assume a propagation speed
of 100 km/hour.
a. Suppose the caravan travels 150 km, beginning in front of one tollbooth,
passing through a second tollbooth, and finishing just after a third toll-
booth. What is the end-to-end delay?

P6. This elementary problem begins to explore propagation delay and transmis-
sion delay, two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts, A
and B, connected by a single link of rate R bps. Suppose that the two hosts
are separated by m meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link
is s meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size L bits to Host B.
a. Express the propagation delay, dprop, in terms of m and s.
b. Determine the transmission time of the packet, dtrans, in terms of L
and R.
c. Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-
to-end delay.
d. Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time t = 0. At time t = dtrans,
where is the last bit of the packet?
e. Suppose dprop is greater than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of
the packet?
f. Suppose dprop is less than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of
the packet?
g. Suppose s = 2.5 · 108, L = 120 bits, and R = 56 kbps. Find the distance m
so that dprop equals dtrans.
P7. In this problem, we consider sending real-time voice from Host A to Host B
over a packet-switched network (VoIP). Host A converts analog voice to a
digital 64 kbps bit stream on the fly. Host A then groups the bits into 56-byte
packets. There is one link between Hosts A and B; its transmission rate is 2
Mbps and its propagation delay is 10 msec. As soon as Host A gathers a
packet, it sends it to Host B. As soon as Host B receives an entire packet, it
converts the packet’s bits to an analog signal. How much time elapses from
the time a bit is created (from the original analog signal at Host A) until the
bit is decoded (as part of the analog signal at Host B)?
P8. Suppose users share a 3 Mbps link. Also suppose each user requires
150 kbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 10 percent of the
time. (See the discussion of packet switching versus circuit switching in
Section 1.3.)
a. When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported?
b. For the remainder of this problem, suppose packet switching is used. Find
the probability that a given user is transmitting.
c. Suppose there are 120 users. Find the probability that at any given time,
exactly n users are transmitting simultaneously. (Hint: Use the binomial
distribution.)
d. Find the probability that there are 21 or more users transmitting
simultaneously.

P9. Consider the discussion in Section 1.3 of packet switching versus circuit
switching in which an example is provided with a 1 Mbps link. Users are
generating data at a rate of 100 kbps when busy, but are busy generating
data only with probability p = 0.1. Suppose that the 1 Mbps link is replaced
by a 1 Gbps link.
a. What is N, the maximum number of users that can be supported
simultaneously under circuit switching?
b. Now consider packet switching and a user population of M users. Give a
formula (in terms of p, M, N) for the probability that more than N users are
sending data.
P10. Consider a packet of length L which begins at end system A and travels over
three links to a destination end system. These three links are connected by
two packet switches. Let di, si, and Ri denote the length, propagation speed,
and the transmission rate of link i, for i = 1, 2, 3. The packet switch delays
each packet by dproc. Assuming no queuing delays, in terms of di, si, Ri,
(i = 1,2,3), and L, what is the total end-to-end delay for the packet? Suppose
now the packet is 1,500 bytes, the propagation speed on all three links is 2.5 ·
108 m/s, the transmission rates of all three links are 2 Mbps, the packet switch
processing delay is 3 msec, the length of the first link is 5,000 km, the length
of the second link is 4,000 km, and the length of the last link is 1,000 km. For
these values, what is the end-to-end delay?
P11. In the above problem, suppose R1 = R2 = R3 = R and dproc = 0. Further sup-
pose the packet switch does not store-and-forward packets but instead imme-
diately transmits each bit it receives before waiting for the entire packet to
arrive. What is the end-to-end delay?
P12. A packet switch receives a packet and determines the outbound link to which
the packet should be forwarded. When the packet arrives, one other packet is
halfway done being transmitted on this outbound link and four other packets
are waiting to be transmitted. Packets are transmitted in order of arrival.
Suppose all packets are 1,500 bytes and the link rate is 2 Mbps. What is the
queuing delay for the packet? More generally, what is the queuing delay
when all packets have length L, the transmission rate is R, x bits of the
currently-being-transmitted packet have been transmitted, and n packets are
already in the queue?
P13. (a) Suppose N packets arrive simultaneously to a link at which no packets
are currently being transmitted or queued. Each packet is of length L
and the link has transmission rate R. What is the average queuing delay
for the N packets?
(b)Now suppose that N such packets arrive to the link every LN/R seconds.
What is the average queuing delay of a packet?

P14. Consider the queuing delay in a router buffer. Let I denote traffic intensity;
that is, I = La/R. Suppose that the queuing delay takes the form IL/R (1 – I)
for I < 1.
a. Provide a formula for the total delay, that is, the queuing delay plus the
transmission delay.
b. Plot the total delay as a function of L/R.
P15. Let a denote the rate of packets arriving at a link in packets/sec, and let μ
denote the link’s transmission rate in packets/sec. Based on the formula for
the total delay (i.e., the queuing delay plus the transmission delay) derived in
the previous problem, derive a formula for the total delay in terms of a and μ.
P16. Consider a router buffer preceding an outbound link. In this problem, you will
use Little’s formula, a famous formula from queuing theory. Let N denote the
average number of packets in the buffer plus the packet being transmitted. Let
a denote the rate of packets arriving at the link. Let d denote the average total
delay (i.e., the queuing delay plus the transmission delay) experienced by a
packet. Little’s formula is N = a · d. Suppose that on average, the buffer con-
tains 10 packets, and the average packet queuing delay is 10 msec. The link’s
transmission rate is 100 packets/sec. Using Little’s formula, what is the aver-
age packet arrival rate, assuming there is no packet loss?
P17. a. Generalize Equation 1.2 in Section 1.4.3 for heterogeneous processing
rates, transmission rates, and propagation delays.
b. Repeat (a), but now also suppose that there is an average queuing delay of
dqueue at each node.
P18. Perform a Traceroute between source and destination on the same continent
at three different hours of the day.
a. Find the average and standard deviation of the round-trip delays at each of
the three hours.
b. Find the number of routers in the path at each of the three hours. Did the
paths change during any of the hours?
c. Try to identify the number of ISP networks that the Traceroute packets pass
through from source to destination. Routers with similar names and/or similar
IP addresses should be considered as part of the same ISP. In your experiments,
do the largest delays occur at the peering interfaces between adjacent ISPs?
d. Repeat the above for a source and destination on different continents.
Compare the intra-continent and inter-continent results.
P19. (a) Visit the site www.traceroute.org and perform  traceroutes from two different
cities in France to the same destination host in the United States. How many
links are the same in the two traceroutes? Is the transatlantic link the same?

Germany.
(c) Pick a city in the United States, and perform traceroutes to two hosts, each
in a different city in China. How many links are common in the two
traceroutes? Do the two traceroutes diverge before reaching China?
P20. Consider the throughput example corresponding to Figure 1.20(b). Now
suppose that there are M client-server pairs rather than 10. Denote Rs, Rc, and
R for the rates of the server links, client links, and network link. Assume all
other links have abundant capacity and that there is no other traffic in the
network besides the traffic generated by the M client-server pairs. Derive a
general expression for throughput in terms of Rs, Rc, R, and M.
P21. Consider Figure 1.19(b). Now suppose that there are M paths between the
server and the client. No two paths share any link. Path k (k = 1, . . ., M ) con-
sists of N links with transmission rates Rk

2, . . ., Rk
N. If the server can only
use one path to send data to the client, what is the maximum throughput that
the server can achieve? If the server can use all M paths to send data, what is
the maximum throughput that the server can achieve?
P22. Consider Figure 1.19(b). Suppose that each link between the server and the
client has a packet loss probability p, and the packet loss probabilities for
these links are independent. What is the probability that a packet (sent by the
server) is successfully received by the receiver? If a packet is lost in the path
from the server to the client, then the server will re-transmit the packet. On
average, how many times will the server re-transmit the packet in order for
the client to successfully receive the packet?
P23. Consider Figure 1.19(a). Assume that we know the bottleneck link along the
path from the server to the client is the first link with rate Rs bits/sec. Suppose
we send a pair of packets back to back from the server to the client, and there
is no other traffic on this path. Assume each packet of size L bits, and both
links have the same propagation delay dprop.
a. What is the packet inter-arrival time at the destination? That is, how much
time elapses from when the last bit of the first packet arrives until the last
bit of the second packet arrives?
b. Now assume that the second link is the bottleneck link (i.e., Rc < Rs). Is it
possible that the second packet queues at the input queue of the second
link? Explain. Now suppose that the server sends the second packet T sec-
onds after sending the first packet. How large must T be to ensure no
queuing before the second link? Explain.
P24. Suppose you would like to urgently deliver 40 terabytes data from Boston to

P28. Refer again to problem P25.
a. How long does it take to send the file, assuming it is sent continuously?
b. Suppose now the file is broken up into 20 packets with each packet con-
taining 40,000 bits. Suppose that each packet is acknowledged by the
receiver and the transmission time of an acknowledgment packet is
negligible. Finally, assume that the sender cannot send a packet until the
preceding one is acknowledged. How long does it take to send the file?
c. Compare the results from (a) and (b).
P29. Suppose there is a 10 Mbps microwave link between a geostationary satellite
and its base station on Earth. Every minute the satellite takes a digital photo and
sends it to the base station. Assume a propagation speed of 2.4  108 meters/sec.
a. What is the propagation delay of the link?
b. What is the bandwidth-delay product, R · dprop?
c. Let x denote the size of the photo. What is the minimum value of x for the
microwave link to be continuously transmitting?
P30. Consider the airline travel analogy in our discussion of layering in Section
1.5, and the addition of headers to protocol data units as they flow down

the protocol stack. Is there an equivalent notion of header information that
is added to passengers and baggage as they move down the airline protocol
stack?
P31. In modern packet-switched networks, including the Internet, the source host
segments long, application-layer messages (for example, an image or a music
file) into smaller packets and sends the packets into the network. The receiver
then reassembles the packets back into the original message. We refer to this
process as message segmentation. Figure 1.27 illustrates the end-to-end
transport of a message with and without message segmentation. Consider a
message that is 8 · 106 bits long that is to be sent from source to destination in
Figure 1.27. Suppose each link in the figure is 2 Mbps. Ignore propagation,
queuing, and processing delays.
a. Consider sending the message from source to destination without message
segmentation. How long does it take to move the message from the source
host to the first packet switch? Keeping in mind that each switch uses
store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total time to move the
message from source host to destination host?
b. Now suppose that the message is segmented into 800 packets, with each
packet being 10,000 bits long. How long does it take to move the first
packet from source host to the first switch? When the first packet is being
sent from the first switch to the second switch, the second packet is being
sent from the source host to the first switch. At what time will the second
packet be fully received at the first switch?
c. How long does it take to move the file from source host to destination host
when message segmentation is used? Compare this result with your
answer in part (a) and comment.

P33. Consider sending a large file of F bits from Host A to Host B. There are three
links (and two switches) between A and B, and the links are uncongested (that
is, no queuing delays). Host A segments the file into segments of S bits each and
adds 80 bits of header to each segment, forming packets of L = 80 + S bits. Each
link has a transmission rate of R bps. Find the value of S that minimizes the
delay of moving the file from Host A to Host B. Disregard propagation delay.

Wireshark Lab
“Tell me and I forget. Show me and I remember. Involve me and I understand.”
Chinese proverb
One’s understanding of network protocols can often be greatly deepened by seeing
them in action and by playing around with them—observing the sequence of mes-
sages exchanged between two protocol entities, delving into the details of protocol
operation, causing protocols to perform certain actions, and observing these actions
and their consequences. This can be done in simulated scenarios or in a real network
environment such as the Internet. The Java applets at the textbook Web site take the
first approach. In the Wireshark labs, we’ll take the latter approach. You’ll run net-
work applications in various scenarios using a computer on your desk, at home, or
in a lab. You’ll observe the network protocols in your computer, interacting and
exchanging messages with protocol entities executing elsewhere in the Internet.
Thus, you and your computer will be an integral part of these live labs. You’ll
observe—and you’ll learn—by doing.
The basic tool for observing the messages exchanged between executing
protocol entities is called a packet sniffer. As the name suggests, a packet sniffer
passively copies (sniffs) messages being sent from and received by your computer;
it also displays the contents of the various protocol fields of these captured mes-
sages. A screenshot of the Wireshark packet sniffer is shown in Figure 1.28. Wire-
shark is a free packet sniffer that runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, and Mac

Leonard Kleinrock
Leonard Kleinrock is a professor of computer science at the University
of California, Los Angeles. In 1969, his computer at UCLA became
the first node of the Internet. His creation of packet-switching princi-
ples in 1961 became the technology behind the Internet. He
received his B.E.E. from the City College of New York (CCNY) and
his masters and PhD in electrical engineering from MIT.
AN INTERVIEW WITH...
What made you decide to specialize in networking/Internet technology?
As a PhD student at MIT in 1959, I looked around and found that most of my classmates
were doing research in the area of information theory and coding theory. At MIT, there was
the great researcher, Claude Shannon, who had launched these fields and had solved most of
the important problems already. The research problems that were left were hard and of less-
er consequence. So I decided to launch out in a new area that no one else had yet conceived
of. Remember that at MIT I was surrounded by lots of computers, and it was clear to me
that soon these machines would need to communicate with each other. At the time, there
was no effective way for them to do so, so I decided to develop the technology that would
permit efficient and reliable data networks to be created.
What was your first job in the computer industry? What did it entail?
I went to the evening session at CCNY from 1951 to 1957 for my bachelor’s degree in
electrical engineering. During the day, I worked first as a technician and then as an engi-
neer at a small, industrial electronics firm called Photobell. While there, I introduced
digital technology to their product line. Essentially, we were using photoelectric devices
to detect the presence of certain items (boxes, people, etc.) and the use of a circuit
known then as a bistable multivibrator was just the kind of technology we needed to
bring digital processing into this field of detection. These circuits happen to be the build-
ing blocks for computers, and have come to be known as flip-flops or switches in today’s
vernacular.
What was going through your mind when you sent the first host-to-host message (from
UCLA to the Stanford Research Institute)?
Frankly, we had no idea of the importance of that event. We had not prepared a special mes-
sage of historic significance, as did so many inventors of the past (Samuel Morse with “What
hath God wrought.” or Alexander Graham Bell with “Watson, come here! I want you.” or
Neal Amstrong with “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.”) Those
guys were smart! They understood media and public relations. All we wanted to do was to
login to the SRI computer. So we typed the “L”, which was correctly received, we typed the
“o” which was received, and then we typed the “g” which caused the SRI host computer to

crash! So, it turned out that our message was the shortest and perhaps the most prophetic
message ever, namely “Lo!” as in “Lo and behold!”
Earlier that year, I was quoted in a UCLA press release saying that once the network was
up and running, it would be possible to gain access to computer utilities from our homes and
offices as easily as we gain access to electricity and telephone connectivity. So my vision at
that time was that the Internet would be ubiquitous, always on, always available, anyone with
any device could connect from any location, and it would be invisible. However, I never
anticipated that my 99-year-old mother would use the Internet—and indeed she did!
What is your vision for the future of networking?
The easy part of the vision is to predict the infrastructure itself. I anticipate that we see con-
siderable deployment of nomadic computing, mobile devices, and smart spaces. Indeed, the
availability of lightweight, inexpensive, high-performance, portable computing, and commu-
nication devices (plus the ubiquity of the Internet) has enabled us to become nomads.
Nomadic computing refers to the technology that enables end users who travel from place to
place to gain access to Internet services in a transparent fashion, no matter where they travel
and no matter what device they carry or gain access to. The harder part of the vision is to
predict the applications and services, which have consistently surprised us in dramatic ways
(email, search technologies, the world-wide-web, blogs, social networks, user generation, and
sharing of music, photos, and videos, etc.). We are on the verge of a new class of surprising
and innovative mobile applications delivered to our hand-held devices.
The next step will enable us to move out from the netherworld of cyberspace to the
physical world of smart spaces. Our environments (desks, walls, vehicles, watches, belts, and
so on) will come alive with technology, through actuators, sensors, logic, processing, storage,
cameras, microphones, speakers, displays, and communication. This embedded technology
will allow our environment to provide the IP services we want. When I walk into a room, the
room will know I entered. I will be able to communicate with my environment naturally, as
in spoken English; my requests will generate replies that present Web pages to me from wall
displays, through my eyeglasses, as speech, holograms, and so forth.
Looking a bit further out, I see a networking future that includes the following addi-
tional key components. I see intelligent software agents deployed across the network
whose function it is to mine data, act on that data, observe trends, and carry out tasks
dynamically and adaptively. I see considerably more network traffic generated not so much
by humans, but by these embedded devices and these intelligent software agents. I see
large collections of self-organizing systems controlling this vast, fast network. I see huge
amounts of information flashing across this network instantaneously with this information
undergoing enormous processing and filtering. The Internet will essentially be a pervasive
global nervous system. I see all these things and more as we move headlong through the
twenty-first century.

What people have inspired you professionally?
By far, it was Claude Shannon from MIT, a brilliant researcher who had the ability to relate
his mathematical ideas to the physical world in highly intuitive ways. He was on my PhD
thesis committee.
Do you have any advice for students entering the networking/Internet field?
The Internet and all that it enables is a vast new frontier, full of amazing challenges. There
is room for great innovation. Don’t be constrained by today’s technology. Reach out and
imagine what could be and then make it happen.
