Abstract. Large-scale peer-to-peer systems face security threats from faulty or
hostile remote computing elements.  To resist these threats, many such systems
employ redundancy.  However, if a single faulty entity can present multiple
identities, it can control a substantial fraction of the system, thereby
undermining this redundancy.  One approach to preventing these “Sybil
attacks” is to have a trusted agency certify identities.  This paper shows that,
without a logically centralized authority, Sybil attacks are always possible
except under extreme and unrealistic assumptions of resource parity and
coordination among entities.
1   Introduction
We* argue that it is practically impossible, in a distributed computing environment, for
initially unknown remote computing elements to present convincingly distinct
identities.  With no logically central, trusted authority to vouch for a one-to-one
correspondence between entity and identity, it is always possible for an unfamiliar
entity to present more than one identity, except under conditions that are not
practically realizable for large-scale distributed systems.
Peer-to-peer systems commonly rely on the existence of multiple, independent
remote entities to mitigate the threat of hostile peers.  Many systems [3, 4, 8, 10, 17,
18, 29, 34, 36] replicate computational or storage tasks among several remote sites to
protect against integrity violations (data loss).  Others [5, 6, 7, 16, 28] fragment tasks
among several remote sites to protect against privacy violations (data leakage).  In
either case, exploiting the redundancy in the system requires the ability to determine
whether two ostensibly different remote entities are actually different.
If the local entity has no direct physical knowledge of remote entities, it perceives
them only as informational abstractions that we call identities.  The system must
ensure that distinct identities refer to distinct entities; otherwise, when the local entity
selects a subset of identities to redundantly perform a remote operation, it can be
duped into selecting a single remote entity multiple times, thereby defeating the
redundancy.  We term the forging of multiple identities a Sybil attack [30] on the
system.

* Use of the plural pronoun is customary even in solely authored research papers; however,
given the subject of the present paper, its use herein is particularly ironic.

It is tempting to envision a system in which established identities vouch for other
identities, so that an entity can accept new identities by trusting the collective
assurance of multiple (presumably independent) signatories, analogous to the PGP
web of trust [37] for human entities.  However, our results show that, in the absence of
a trusted identification authority (or unrealistic assumptions about the resources
available to an attacker), a Sybil attack can severely compromise the initial generation
of identities, thereby undermining the chain of vouchers.
Identification authorities can take various forms, not merely that of an explicit
certification agency such as VeriSign [33].  For example, the CFS cooperative storage
system [8] identifies each node (in part) by a hash of its IP address.  The SFS network
file system [23] names remote paths by appending a host identifier to a DNS name.
The EMBASSY [22] platform binds machines to cryptographic keys embedded in
device hardware.  These approaches may thwart Sybil attacks, but they implicitly rely
on the authority of a trusted agency (such as ICANN [19] or Wave Systems [35]) to
establish identity.
In the following section, we define a model of a distributed computing environment
that lacks a central authority.  Building on this model, Section 3 proves a series of
lemmas that severely limit the ability of an entity to determine identity.  Section 4
surveys related work, and Section 5 concludes.
2   Formal Model
As a backdrop for our results, we construct a formal model of a generic distributed
computing environment.  Our model definition implicitly limits the obstructive power
of corrupt entities, thereby strengthening our negative results.  The universe, shown
schematically in Fig. 1, includes:
•
A set E of infrastructural entities e
•
A broadcast communication cloud
•
A pipe connecting each entity to the cloud
Set E is partitioned into two disjoint subsets, C and F.  Each entity c in subset C is
correct, abiding by the rules of any protocol we define.  Each entity f in subset F is
faulty, capable of performing any arbitrary behavior except as limited by explicit
resource constraints.  (The terms “correct” and “faulty” are standard in the domain of
Byzantine fault tolerance [21], even though terms such as “honest” and “deceptive”
might be more appropriate.)
Entities communicate by means of messages.  A message is an uninterrupted, finite-
length bit string whose meaning is determined either by an explicit protocol or by an
implicit agreement among a set of entities.  An entity can send a message through its
pipe, thereby broadcasting it to all other entities.  The message will be received by all
entities within a bounded interval of time.  Message delivery is guaranteed, but there is
no assurance that all entities will hear messages in the same order.
This model has two noteworthy qualities:  First, it is quite general.  By leaving the
internals of the cloud unspecified, this model includes virtually any interconnection
topology of shared segments, dedicated links, routers, switches, or other components.

Second, the environment in this model is very friendly.  In particular, in the absence of
resource constraints, denial-of-service attacks are not possible.  A message from a
correctly functioning entity is guaranteed to reach all other correctly functioning
entities.
We place a minimal restriction on the relative computational resources available to
each entity, namely that there exists some security parameter n for which all entities
can perform operations whose computational complexity is (low-order) polynomial in
n but for which no entity can perform operations that are superpolynomial in n.  This
restriction allows entities to use public-key cryptography [24] to establish virtual
point-to-point communication paths that are private and authenticated.  Although these
virtual paths are as secure as point-to-point physical links, they come to exist only
when created by pairs of entities that have acknowledged each other.  Our model
excludes direct links between entities because a physical link provides a form of
centrally supplied identification of a distinct remote entity.  Also, in the real world,
packets can be sniffed and spoofed, so the base assumption of a broadcast medium
(augmented by cryptography) is not unrealistic.
An identity is an abstract representation that persists across multiple
communication events.  Each entity e attempts to present an identity i to other entities
in the system.  (Without loss of generality, we state our results with respect to a
specific local entity l that is assumed to be correct.)  If e successfully presents identity
i to l, we say that l accepts identity i.
A straightforward form for an identity is a secure hash of a public key.  Under
standard cryptographic assumptions, such an identifier is unforgeable.  Furthermore,
since it can generate a symmetric key for a communication session, it is also persistent
in a useful way.

Each correct entity c will attempt to present one legitimate identity.  Each faulty
entity f may attempt to present a legitimate identity and one or more counterfeit
identities.  Ideally, the system should accept all legitimate identities but no counterfeit
entities.
3   Results
This section presents four simple lemmas, with nearly trivial proofs, that collectively
show the impracticality of establishing distinct identities in a large-scale distributed
system.
An entity has three potential sources of information about other entities: a trusted
agency, itself, or other (untrusted) entities.  In the absence of a trusted authority, either
an entity accepts only identities that it has directly validated (by some means) or it also
accepts identities vouched for by other identities it has already accepted.
For direct validation, we show:
•
Even when severely resource constrained, a faulty entity can counterfeit a
constant number of multiple identities.
•
Each correct entity must simultaneously validate all the identities it is
presented; otherwise, a faulty entity can counterfeit an unbounded number
of identities.
Large-scale distributed systems are inevitably heterogeneous, leading to resource
disparities that exacerbate the former result.  The latter result presents a direct
impediment to scalability.
For indirect validation, in which an entity accepts identities that are vouched for by
already accepted identities, we show:
•
A sufficiently large set of faulty entities can counterfeit an unbounded
number of identities.
•
All entities in the system must perform their identity validations
concurrently; otherwise, a faulty entity can counterfeit a constant number
of multiple identities.
Since the number of faulty entities in the system is likely to grow as the system size
increases, the former result places another limit on system scale.  The latter restriction
becomes harder to satisfy as system size increases.
3.1   Direct Identity Validation
The only direct means by which two entities can convince a third entity that they are
distinct is by performing some task that a single entity could not.  If we assume that
the resources of any two entities differ by at most a constant factor, a local entity can
demand proof of a remote entity’s resources before accepting its identity.  However,
this leaves us with the following limitation:

---

Lemma 1. If ρ is the ratio of the resources of a faulty entity f to the resources of a
minimally capable entity, then f can present g = ρ distinct identities to local entity l.
Proof. Define rM as the resources available to a minimally capable entity.  By
hypothesis, g entities can present g identities to l; therefore, g rM resources are
sufficient to present g identities.  Since ρ ≥ g, f has at least g rM resources available, so
it can present g identities to l.
Lemma 1 states a lower bound on the damage achievable by a faulty entity.  To
show how this can be enforced as an upper bound, we present three mechanisms that
can (at least theoretically) exploit limitations in three different resources:
communication, storage, and computation.
If communication resources are restricted, local entity l can broadcast a request for
identities and then only accept replies that occur within a given time interval.
If storage resources are restricted, entity l can challenge each identity to store a
large amount of unique, uncompressible data.  By keeping small excerpts of this data,
entity l can verify, with arbitrarily high probability, that all identities simultaneously
store the data they were sent.
If computation resources are restricted, entity l can challenge each identity to solve
a unique computational puzzle.  For example, the local entity can generate a large
random value y and challenge the identity to find, within a limited time, a pair of
values x, z such that the concatenation x | y | z, when run through a secure hash
function, yields a value whose least significant n bits are all zero:
given y, find x, z s.t. LSBn(hash(x | y | z))  =  0
The time to solve* such a puzzle is proportional to 2n–1.  The time to verify the result
is constant.  (The reason for allowing the challenged entity to find a prefix x and a
suffix z, rather than merely one or the other, will become clear in Section 3.2.)
To be effective, these resource challenges must be issued to all identities
simultaneously:
Lemma 2. If local entity l accepts entities that are not validated simultaneously, then a
single faulty entity f can present an arbitrarily large number of distinct identities to
entity l.
Proof. Faulty entity f presents an arbitrarily long succession of distinct identities to l.
The resources required for each presentation are used and then freed for the
subsequent presentation.

* measured in count of hash function evaluations.  For a random oracle [2] hash function, the
only way to find a solution is to iterate through candidate values of x and/or z; compute the
hash for each x | y | z triple; and test the result.  Actual implementation requires a hash
function that is both preimage-resistant and resistant to non-brute-force attacks such as
chaining attacks [24].

Lemma 2 is insurmountable for intrinsically temporal resources, such as
computation speed and communication bandwidth.  However, since storage is not
inherently time-based, entity l can indefinitely extend the challenge duration by
periodically demanding to see newly specified excerpts of the stored data.  If an
accepted identity ever fails to meet a new challenge, the local entity can discard it
from its acceptance list, thereby eventually catching a Sybil attack that it might have
initially missed.  A major practical problem with this extension is that (by assumption)
the challenge consumes the majority of an entity’s storage resources, so extending the
challenge duration greatly impedes the ability of the entity to perform other work.
(However, the challenge data itself could be valuable data, compressed and encrypted
by the local entity before sending it to the remote entities, using a different key for
each remote entity to maintain challenge uniqueness.)
3.2   Indirect Identity Validation
As described in the introduction, the reason for establishing the distinctness of
identities is to allow the local entity to employ redundancy in operations it delegates to
remote entities.  One such operation it could conceivably delegate is the validation of
other identities.  Thus, in addition to accepting identities that it has directly validated
using one of the challenge mechanisms described above, an entity might also accept
identities that have been validated by a sufficient count of other identities that it has
already accepted.
If an entity that has presented identity i1 claims to have accepted another entity’s
identity i2, we say that i1 vouches for i2.  An obvious danger of accepting indirectly
validated identities is that a group of faulty entities can vouch for counterfeit
identities:
Lemma 3. If local entity l accepts any identity vouched for by q accepted identities,
then a set F of faulty entities can present an arbitrarily large number of distinct
identities to l if either |F| ≥ q or the collective resources available to F at least equal
those of q + |F| minimally capable entities.
Proof. Define rF as the total resources available to set F, rk as the resources available
to each faulty entity fk, and rM as the resources available to a minimally capable entity.
Then:

By Lemma 1, entity fk can present rk / rM ≥ 1 identities to l, so F can present q
identities to l.  Thereafter, all of F’s identities vouch for an arbitrarily large number of
counterfeit identities, all of which will be accepted by l.
As in the case of direct identity validation, indirect identity validation also has a
concurrency requirement.  In particular, all entities must perform their resource
challenges concurrently:

Lemma 4. If the correct entities in set C do not coordinate time intervals during which
they accept identities, and if local entity l accepts any identity vouched for by q
accepted identities, then even a minimally capable faulty entity f can present g =  |C| /
q  distinct identities to l.
Proof. Define rM as the resources required to present one identity.  By assumption,
entity f has rM resources available.  Partition set C into g disjoint subsets Ck of
minimum cardinality q.  Faulty entity f presents identity ik to each entity in Ck, using rM
resources during time interval Tk.  Since Tk need not overlap with Tk´ for k ≠ k´, rM
resources are available during interval Tk´ to present identity ik´ ≠ ik to entities in set
Ck´.  At least q entities in each set Ck will vouch for distinct identity ik, so l will accept
all g identities.
Lemma 4 shows the need for multiple entities to issue challenges concurrently.
Whether it is possible for a correct entity to satisfy multiple concurrent challenges
depends upon the resource:
In our formal model, all communication is broadcast, so an entity can
simultaneously reply to communication challenges from arbitrarily many entities.
(However, this is rather less practical in actual networks than in our abstract model.)
It may not be possible to satisfy multiple concurrent storage challenges, and there
are information-theoretic reasons for believing that it is impossible, since every bit of
data stored for one challenger consumes one bit of storage space that is thus
unavailable to serve another challenger (and the data from all challengers is, of
necessity, incompressible).  This may prevent storage challenges from being used for
indirect validation.
For computation challenges, it is possible for an entity to solve multiple puzzles
simultaneously by combining them.  If an entity receives m puzzles y1, y2, … ym, it can
find a w such that:
LSBn(hash(0 | y1 | y2 | … ym | w))  =  0
Then, the solution to each puzzle yk is:
xk  =  0 | y1 | y2 | … yk–1  and  zk  =  yk+1 | … ym | w
An obvious danger here is that if a validating entity issues challenges to multiple
identities that have been counterfeited by a single faulty entity, the faulty entity could
combine the challenges and solve them together.  However, the challenger can identify
this attempted Sybil attack by checking whether x1 | y1 | z1 = x2 | y2 | z2 for any two
solutions from putatively different identities.
Like Lemma 1, the result of Lemma 4 is that a faulty entity can amplify its
influence.  A system that can tolerate a fraction φ of all identities being faulty can
tolerate only φ/g of all entities being faulty.  In some systems, this may be acceptable.

4   Related Work
Most prior research on electronic identities has focused on persistence and
unforgeability [14, 15, 27, 31], rather than on distinctness.
Computational puzzles are an old technique [25] that has become popular recently
for resisting denial-of-service attacks [1, 9, 20] by forcing the attacker to perform
more work than the victim.
Dingledine et al. [11] suggest using puzzles to provide a degree of accountability in
peer-to-peer systems, but this still allows a resourceful attacker to launch a substantial
attack, especially if the potential for damage is disproportionate to the fraction of the
system that is compromised.
The issue of establishing on-line identities for humans has been studied for some
time [12, 32], with solutions that generally depend on some direct interaction in the
physical world [13, 37].
5   Summary and Conclusions
Peer-to-peer systems often rely on redundancy to diminish their dependence on
potentially hostile peers.  If distinct identities for remote entities are not established
either by an explicit certification authority (as in Farsite [3]) or by an implicit one (as
in CFS [8]), these systems are susceptible to Sybil attacks, in which a small number of
entities counterfeit multiple identities so as to compromise a disproportionate share of
the system.
Systems that rely upon implicit certification should be acutely mindful of this
reliance, since apparently unrelated changes to the relied-upon mechanism can
undermine the security of the system.  For example, the proposed IPv6 privacy
extensions [26] obviate much of the central allocation of IP addresses assumed by
CFS.
In the absence of an identification authority, a local entity’s ability to discriminate
among distinct remote entities depends on the assumption that an attacker’s resources
are limited.  Entities can thus issue resource-demanding challenges to validate
identities, and entities can collectively pool the identities they have separately
validated.  This approach entails the following conditions:
•
All entities operate under nearly identical resource constraints.
•
All presented identities are validated simultaneously by all entities,
coordinated across the system.
•
When accepting identities that are not directly validated, the required
number of vouchers exceeds the number of system-wide failures.
We claim that in a large-scale distributed system, these conditions are neither
justifiable as assumptions nor practically realizable as system requirements.
